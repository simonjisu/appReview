Shambhavi Asmit	2021-07-09	2	Zoom was working just fine till last month but recently, I have not been able to connect to any meetings, it is rare for me now to attend a meeting smoothly without getting disconnected or even getting connected in the first place, also, the problems with the audio and screen share are also very concerning, the app keeps glitching all the time, and to add to all of this haphazard, zoom is not letting me sign in or sign up, it is saying that I'm not eligible, overall, it's been a mess, improve.	990
Banisha Nandy	2021-07-09	2	This app was very good at initial time. But this is now going very problematic. Sometimes it stops working nd I have to left the meeting. Instead of giving I'd password nd getting approved by the host, it is impossible to connect to the meeting. I feel disgusted and problematic for that. So, sort out the problem as soon as possible. Thank you	824
saakshi arts music	2021-07-09	1	"This app isn't working well. It always shows ""Connecting"" when I try to connect to my classes. And after a few moments I get a dialog box displaying -""Cannot connect to our service , please check your network connection and try again."" And some error code .. Although I have set up the best network , this app doesn't respond well. I'm missing all my imp.classes due to this issue. One of the worst app I'm using.."	1068
Teaching Fanatic	2021-07-09	5	Hi, zoom. Nowadays, I got a problem. When I am entering into a particular teacher's class who gives the same link by altering the date and class and section, I can't join. Some of my friends too experienced it. But others can see the class. I don't know why it happens to me and my colleagues. Please help me and my friends. Please fix any problem in app or give some tips to join class. Otherwise, your app is playing a vital role in our life. Thank you, Zoom. Please fix my problem.	75
Sapna kumari	2021-07-09	1	Zoom is the worst meeting app I have ever seen. It has many issues and errors of network, connection problem,etc. I am not able to do online classes also properly in this app due to corona. The creators are not solving this problem also. If it had 0 stars, then I would give that but it's not there so I have given 1 star. Plz solve this issue as soon as possible.	37
Jaspinder Brar	2021-07-08	5	The app is really good but now a days I am facing connecting issues whenever I try to join a meeting it only shows connecting. Some of my friends are also facing the same situation. So it is not because of network problems because other apps are working properly. I am a student and I have to join lectures on daily basis. So I hope you will look into the matter try to fix it.	444
Vinti Singla	2021-07-08	1	Yes this app is good and easy to operate.

I'm telling to my teacher that her is some network issue, but how many days will I told them. they will definitely scold me. And Its very difficult for me to skip the classes. And its same in my another phone. So plz zoom solve this problem.	144

Fahmidul Alam Khan	2021-07-08	3	Before the last update of 28 June 2021, it was a good app. But, after updating the app, I've found various types of problems in this app, such as : 1. Connection problem. 2. Network problem. 3. Sound has been lower than before. 4. In the meeting corner, the speakers' photo has been larger than before, for which the part of meeting slides are Covered by the picture. 5. Response emojis are disappeared. Please, fix these problems as soon as possible.	1910
Aditya Kumar	2021-07-09	1	Worst app ever. The app does not meet the quality to become a good app. The demand is higher for its features like Virtual Background , but they don't see the quality of their app, from past few days a new problem has occurred in which while connecting to meetings , it shows error code 104103, and tells to check the internet connection, which is more than 4-5Mbps. Instead of blaming their app, they r blaming people's connection. Brilliant! Hats off to you Zoom Team! Continue This Good Work!üëèüëå	16
Kintada Jayeeshnuvu	2021-07-08	3	Very bad connections with the meeting. Cannot enter the meeting in time. Always shows loading icon and connecting icon when a meeting is entering but cannot enter the meeting. After sometime its shows that there is no proper internet connection to us even there is stable internet connection. At last , have to improve the app very much. Thank you.	74

Harshit Verma	2021-07-08	1	Zoom used to work fine. But from July 08, when I try to connect to a meeting, it is stuck at connecting.. and it gives an error 104103 or 104101. I tried using every device I had Android Tablet, Android phone, Windows Laptop but in vain. All I get is the same error. I have a stable 30 mbps wifi connection. Please fix this bug fast.	8
Rohini Patil	2021-07-09	1	It's the worst app ever. I am using zoom cloud meetings from two years but from the last update it is telling that no network although my network is well. I request to the creators that please fix this problem as soon as possible because we are facing a lot of problems in doing our meetings of schools and offices. Please do something.	9
INTAKHAB ALAM	2021-07-09	1	The Worst meeting app ever used.Very Very BAD üëé experience. A lot of network issue. We are unable to join,it just showing connecting,and at last unable to join please check your network connection, But my network is fine,checking after that,network is very nice. And also can't able to listen what anyone is saying when out of the meeting. Before the new update it had been a nice experience but now I am unable to join only.The older version was the best then ever &ever.I wish I could give 0 star.	13
Kenzie Hunter	2021-07-08	1	I hate this app. Every time I was on call with some my doctor's it was a glitches I was unable to hear what they were saying. But it was other time I was not able to log in and I missed my appointment. The only advice I can give people is don't lay on this app for you life. This app is completely dysfunctional.	48
Pragya Mishra	2021-07-09	1	It has one worst thing that it does not give you the option of changing or edit your profile after first time but before update we was able to change our profile as many time as we want. You should give virtual background in mobile phones too. And one more thing before the last update zoom was better But now after update u made it worst app ever. These are two worst thing I have ever experienced in this app.	5
Anish Raj	2021-07-09	2	Dear Sir/Ma'am, I can't connect to the zoom meeting. It is showing error and keeps closing. It is happening from 2-3 days. Before that it was working properly. By the way, I don't know it is happening only with me or my other classmates. I am a student and I have to study through this zoom meeting app. So, I request you to fix the problem so that I can use it without any problems.	7
Angela Treasure	2021-07-05	5	Zoom is a blessing, its not perfect, nothing in this world is perfect, God bless the person or persons who invented this app, keep up the good work, there are some kinks that needs to be straightened out, sometimes voice or picture quality could be better. Picture and voice quality much improved, again, thanks for your service. Voice and picture quality continue to Improve, Thanks	1646
Jyoti Bala	2021-07-08	3	I really like this app, and helps a lot in this paendemic. But there is an issue with the desktop (Windows 10) application. The version has an issue that is it do not show the place where all participants are shown if the main speaker in the meeting at the particular time turned his video off. Is it just me or zoom is not working for everyone today?	1010
Jaspreet Kaur	2021-07-08	1	This app is good. But from yesterday it's not working. I'm not able to attend my classes. It's just showing connecting. There is no network problem in my area. But zoom is not working. Sorry üòê to say, but I don't like this anymore. Solve this issue as soon as possible.

As soon as possible.sir please solve the bugs. I am using this app since 1 years. It was working smoothly. But after updating new version it started showing connecting issues.	5
Elizabeth James Sanna	2021-07-07	1	I hope there was a I way I could give no stars. When ever I try to join a meeting. It always shows unknown error occurred. I also tried to report the issue many times but no solution to those problems. I hate this app. Please do not use it. Google meet is more better.	98
LWJia	2021-07-05	4	Everything is good so far, i've used it for almost a year and it really help my online class. There's one thing about the new update which causes trouble to me is when someone presents with their camera on, the small screen that displays their face blocked the screen which they present. The old way of the screen placement is okay. I hope this can be fixed soon since it is really inconvenient. Thank you.	788
Prathamesh Supal	2021-07-08	1	In starting it was an excellent app but due to recent update there is an issue with the app . App doesn't work properly & shows on connecting meetings that : can't connect to our service check internet connection . Ichecked my connection it was proper all apps were working instead of these app only . I tried clearing data & app chache and also reinstalling the app but it doesn't worked. Pls work on it....	3
Advesh Darvekar	2021-07-08	5	This is the best app for online classes and meetings with family and friends. I love its features. It is very easy to use. There are some small features that make it the best of all other platforms. Like while the teacher is teaching, you can swipe a little bit to pause the frame. This helps if the teacher is about to erase anything from the board. I wish that it could support 2 meetings at a time on one device üòÅ. Its security has improved a lot and you don't have to worry about zoom bombing.	1874
Kanchan Rai	2021-07-09	1	"I am very frustrated with this app.I am not able to join my online classes because of this app. It was very good before the update but after the update it became worst.Every single time I join it always say""Can't connect to our service, please check your network connection and try again.Error code:104101"". Although my network is also very good. Please fix this issue as soon as possible."	4
Deepanshi Malik	2021-07-08	1	Worst app . I wish i could be able to give it 0 star. Earlier it was working very well but now i am not able to connect from my phone . It shows network problem even thought when my net is working very well. And my classes are going on this app and i am not even able to join , because of this isssue , I am not able to study . Please correct the issue .	2074
Sumit N	2021-07-04	4	I like it as the service being provided by this app atleast to a few users other than business employees, is for free. Also because it enables me to save presentation images in my media gallery. Although, I am not able to sign in to Zoom for accessing the ‚ÄòVirtual Background mode‚Äô, maybe due to my age limit as per the terms and conditions of Zoom. Doesn't matters. As of now, the limited features are though enough for me.	1009
Ruchitha kamini	2021-07-09	1	It's going worst and worst for the past one week for me ... while I'm attending classes it's often showing connecting and then its telling that it has a network error and then showing error code . But there is no network error in my area and all other apps keeps working except these app ..I'm being frustrated with this ... please check it as soon as possible	5
Shweta	2021-07-08	2	I wish all the messages send through chat get saved in some file for a day(for a limited time) to review them later without having to copy message again and again during the meetings. And zoom doesn't connect around 10 am ist for some reason I hope it gets fixed soon. It's been 3 days since this problem has continued. :( Error code : 104103	19
Jared H.	2021-07-04	1	Completely unusable mobile experience. Every 2 seconds the audio cuts out for about 1 second. This results in not being able to get anything anyone is saying, & basically cannot use for mobile. Updating to add this issue has been ongoing for months across multiple mobile devices for multiple users. A general Google search find MANY experiencing this. Stable internet, on & off VPN's, different internet connections, different routers, on & off wifi, but the problem persists.	107
Harbhej bath	2021-07-07	4	Overall good but sometimes I face problems like unable to join meeting . It's major problem for me which I mostly face . Please solve this problem. I face it both on lptoo and mobile usually . And also I restart my phone nd check my network bt didn't found any problem in it . Please solve this issue otherwise it is superb app and becoz of jst this issue I have give it 4 stars	4
Sabita Sahoo	2021-07-08	1	This is the worst app I've ever experienced worst means worst!!! This app was being used by our school before it was okay but now in all meetings nobody literally all of them in our school face this problem. Zoom please see to it and be to it. Sort out this problem as fast as you could. Don't just gain ratings. I will give you good feedback till you'll sort out this problem. Don't expect this from me.	2
Pirty Kumawat	2021-07-08	1	This app was good but now I am facing a lot of trouble in opening the app this always shows that connecting on the top and then a error comes about the network but my network is absolutely fine.I am a student and I have to take lectures on a daily basis. So, I request to zoom to solve my problem as soon as possible.	19
Vandita Negi	2021-07-07	3	I tried to connect my class but didn't connect. after having a good network speed of 35 MBPS it still shows we check your network connection and try again.

Vedanti Gawade	2021-07-08	3	Its really a nice app. But from yesterday I am having an issue that I am having network issue but I don't have any network issues the network is running nice on other apps. So please check this and fix it. I read other comments also on this same issue.	4
Vaishnav Sheramkar	2021-07-07	1	Something is wrong in this app because if there is 5G internet, then too sometimes it requires wifi to join meeting and if we turn of wifi after joining meeting then after few movements it gets disconnected to meeting so I request the app engineer to resolve these problem, as I'm a student it is very necessary to attend my entire classes because I am an future of my country so I request you to find some solution on these problems and I have trust on zoom so Thank you for reading my opinion..	39
Kanishka N S	2021-07-08	2	First two classes went well . After that everytime when I click the link or enter the id it starts loading ..when connecting gets more time it says can't connect to the server ... So many times I missed two classes of this . How can my connection gets wrong everytime what's happening on your app.. connecting connecting how many times .... Yesterday also same happened and today too. I don't know how many of them faced . Worst app	7
Kasham Madhuri	2021-07-08	1	"Okay, I am using this app for many months now to attend my online classes, and now, whenever I'm opening a link sent by my teacher , a message is displaying on the screen called "" an unknown error occured/check your network connection"", my network is pretty good , I have even reported my problem many times but no response. Due to this I am missing my classes,I don't even have the option to change to different app because my school conducts classes from this app only, I request zoom to fix this"	14
Haris Lateef_46	2021-07-08	1	This app was good. But since few days it's showing some kinda error 104103.Although everything is good in my phone like network connection. But still it's doesn't work. I have lectures on daily. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible.	2

Manohar Bhagwani	2021-07-08	1	In the starting the zoom works best but nowadays we are not able to join any meeting. It shows that check your network connection and error code 420411. Our meetings is important so we have to join it regularly. I hope that zoom will understand the mistake and solve it soon. And our class is continue without any problem.	8
Crazy Cassidy	2021-07-07	3	This is a great app but when I'm chatting with my friends, and I have to share a photo with them, the photo album is not showing any pictures, and when it does have pictures, it's only showing me OLD photos. Y'all need to fix my problem so I can give a higher rate	5
Kalyani Tammu	2021-07-07	3	It is a very good app i should say. I should say about the audio quality is that it breaks in between when someone is speaking and the video quality is not that good (sometimes only) that when someone is screen sharing in my online classes , also i am not able to share my screen.And i am not able to download the emoji library. So that is the problem i face in the app otherwise it is very good Thank you	5
Kewal Singh	2021-07-01	3	Everything is okay with me while using the application but only the think that irritates me is whenever the internet connection goes down for just a few seconds only, the zoom interface is also disappeared. I'll say that zoom is much better than Google meet but in meet we see that after the instability of network, still we can see google meet atmost for a minute. So please work on it. Thank you.	1489
Javier MM	2021-07-09	4	From the most popular apps, Zoom is my favourite one. Intuitive. Simple. Smart. 4 stars and not 5 since I'm experiencing that I can't share audio with the quality I'd like to. I hope they'll improve this in the near future.	0
The 2 Sisters	2021-07-06	3	This isnt really I was expecting and I think you guys should recieve 3 stars only... I never have given a applocation ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ stars... The reason I gave 3 ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ because Whenever I am reading a school textbook online... I am getting disconnected everytime. my teacher is now fed up and thinks that I have bad internet connection still I have unlimited for my school... So... Also if I clicked leave by mistakly then I automatically get disconnected for a stupid reason. plz solve the issue...	9
Jewell Fernandes	2021-07-03	3	I won't rate this app a 5 star! It's one of my least favorites.. I don't know why but even after having full WiFi connection it still doesn't work..but the best part is that it works well..all features are very easy to use and If there was no such problem I would have rated 5 stars!üòÅ I hope they do some changes ‚ò∫Ô∏è	269
‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øá ‡Æâ‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Øç !! Thamizhe Vuyir !!	2021-07-06	4	It is really useful when we need to represent some thing live . I have joined many programmes but in zoom only it is perfect but the problem is , zoom doesn't work with a little bit low network connection but It is really useful for many things which can be done online. Another problem is only 1000 (one thousand )people can on.y join in one meeting.	548
Kavita Bhalerao	2021-07-08	1	Firstly it was working good but after I was getting problem on my Laptop. Somtimes I was not able to connect to my Computer Audio and sometime also I am not able to on my Laptop video camera. Also my son and daughter are getting trouble to study on Zoom Meeting.

Manasa Naveen	2021-07-08	5	It's a good app I would love to give 5 stars based on camera clarity as well as our Mik usage.... Loved it.... But the only problem that occurred today is I'm not not able to log in to the meeting.... It shows connecting but never lets in.... I'm done looking at all the solutions on Google please do something and fix the problem....a humble request!	25
Golden Grahams	2021-07-09	3	The last update has caused the phone to heat up/overheat more than normal. To the point that I can't use split screen for more than a few minutes. When I'm not using split screen it is still noticeable how hot the phone. It also is very heavy on battery consumption.	3
Thyagaraju H C	2021-07-08	1	Zoom app is very bad app and not working properly because i am no able to attend the class from 2 days it will show connecting (network error code 104101) even i have very good network not only me my friends also have these problem this version is very bad and it is having lot of problems please slove it fast. Old version was very good. Google meet is 100% better than this app.so I will give only 1 start	0
rajinder jit singh	2021-06-30	3	It's good to use but the issue is of virtual background. It is only supported in certain Android mobiles. A mobile or a computer which is one or two year old version does not support virtual background which is not good. A simple software which supports all Android including old versions should be able to get this virtual background.	1530
VJ S	2021-07-07	2	Still replete with design flaws. Crashes. Unreliable. Controls are not intuitive. Can't tell if video falls out of mute. Loses recordings in the paid version. Can't run in the background. Zero support. Use anything else. Deeply frustrating.	5
Neetu Das	2021-07-07	1	enough is enough...this app has so many queries...and I am seriously fed up of the problem of disconnecting again and again , and error code...after each and every minute the meeting disconnect and the error code occurs...And the audio and video quality is also not good...So poor Zoom... Not willing to give you even a single star...and seriously I will not share this app with anyone :(	262
YASH ThAKuR	2021-07-08	4	Wondering why I gave 4 stars... Well I will rate it 5 stars... Yes you read it right if u fix a problem... The problem is as follows: When I was in my meeting with my friend suddenly when annotating the anotating option that suddenly disappeared I was not able to understand it properly... So I restarted my device and it worked but still I was in shock when this happened... If u fix this issue then reply me so that I can know that the issue is fixed... Then I will change my rating to 5 stars.....	18
AP TOPPER CLASS 6 TO 10	2021-07-05	3	There are lots of bugs and problem 1 . When our network is weak then the meeting is automatically disconnected . 2. When we send the massage on personal chat in zoom during meeting then how can I know which person I send massage he/she read or not so you can lunch any thing which shows the massage readed or not readed . Other things is good there are problems so I don't give 5 stars . Thanks for reading my Feedback .	12
Arvind Gupta	2021-07-04	3	I gave it three stars because this is a vry good app bt two pronlems are there, first one is class takes time to join and if little network issue is there then the class gets disconnected. N the second reason is it doesnt support virtual background in all the mobile phones , my mobile phone is only 5 to 6 days old after that also it doesnt support virtual background , except in some androids and laptops .. So please fix these two issues as soon as possible.	47
Cute girl Shreya	2021-07-08	1	This app is good.. but when I enter the meeting it's written connecting I wait after that it is written can't connect to your service error..before it doesn't happens now only it happens fix this issue..I can't do my online classes..and also it uses lot of battery and mobile data..my battery gets drains easily..fix this	10
Eva Wood	2021-07-07	5	First time using this app, met with a therapist, definitely better than talking on the phone without video, it was like I was actually visiting with her in person, seems like every conversation should be on Zoom instead of the phone. Going to try to use this for more conversations in the future. Thanks Zoom and Thank you Alexandria!	133
Arshdeep Sandhu	2021-07-08	2	"At starting the app was working good....

Merina Chaudhary	2021-07-08	1	I don't like this app. I am not able to sign in how much I try because of this Issue. I miss my 4 classes and still missing it.

Matthew Dimmett	2021-07-04	4	Great meeting app. Definitely ahead of it's time. I wish it was a bit more universal though. As in the controls are the exact same for a @ndroid, iphone, tablet, ipad, or laptop. Touch control obviously not one of them. But I'd be nice to have your raise hand feature out with the mute button all around for every device.	21

This is quite understanable that this app has a lot of features and also it is also working even if a certain application is open so battery regularly will decrease but I just make it clearly this issue can be considered a check."""	3

Bruce Mocking	2021-06-21	4	Zoom is handy for meetings and other video get-togethers. I like the various views and ability for sharing files. IMO some settings are not easy to use. Some settings are not accessible depending on the device you are using, and where you need to go to access settings varies from device to device. There is a bit of a learning curve. Overall a very good app. Audio can sometimes sound distorted, but this can often be corrected by the person muting and then unmuting.	9320

Femida Abdullah	2021-06-21	2	[Updated] Before it was working well even if I had to restart my phone, but now that is not helping either. I'm not giving a 1 star because I only use it for one class, and it has two good features like private chat option and easy accessible whiteboard. To be honest, Google meet is far better, even though it don't have the features I mentioned for Zoom. I will uninstall this stupid app the moment I'll be able to do so.	8039

Hemlata Bramhankar	2021-07-08	4	It was overall good app. But onwe thing I notice that it could not see video clearly. The video was somewhat burr.	0
Scarlett Hellish	2021-06-25	2	Not worth 5 stars, you should improve your app, seriously. I've had enough with the screen doesn't want to go with portrait mode sometimes, and the bar won't close even after I tap on the screen a million times already, same as the backwards. The audio is okay, but the video isn't in the best rate. So I give you 2 ‚≠ês bcus of anothe reason too, for now, until you fix all this things and you really should read your app users comments and do something about it.	751
Mosin Shaikh	2021-07-02	5	App is amazing but missing few things as mentioned below. Can you please add password protection settings as we have in all other apps like WhatsApp etc. That means we can only access app if we enter passcode or fingerprint sensor?	1

Arun Teja Rtf	2021-07-01	2	It would be better if zoom provides option to disable drawing for participants when Host is sharing screen.The participants are irritating by drawing on screen.I Hope zoom will consider my Feedback	0
Ricardo Romo	2021-06-20	1	App is not working. It won't send activation/confirmation email for new accounts. I bought a new phone thinking it was maybe my cell that wasn't working. Turns out it the app! Even with my nieces help I couldn't get past the activation/confirmation email. I hope it gets fixed soon I've been trying to get a zoom account for a couple of weeks already.	1610
Robert Cutchens	2021-06-17	4	I installed this app on my Galaxy Tab S7+ and it works very well. I'm used to using the Windows version and noticed the following: 1. You can only display up to four other cameras on a single page at a time and need to scroll to see others. 2. No hotkeys/shortcuts support to mute/unmute your mic or enable/disable your video. I have a BT keyboard and understand developers built this app for devices without a KB but would be nice to have these features added. Even so, it still works great!	1341

I'm taking Some classes via Zoom&I love being able to do this from anywhere on my cell phone!!	0
Pratikshya Priyadarshani Mahalik	2021-07-07	1	I just hate this app.....üò°üò°the quality of video is very poor...and sometimes my network is speed but this app says poor connection of network......üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°it's a very bad app please don't install it...	0

Martin Bartlett	2021-06-23	2	So a year and half later, and the Android app still can't use a Bluetooth speaker and still can't broadcast a 16/9 camera view. And all the comments I've seen concerning reporting these problems indicate zero interest in fixing them shown by the company. So this is highly likely to be an app and service that will soon fall into disuse as quickly as it rose to prominence.	1249

Tammy Delbruegge	2021-06-17	3	I have to mute the audio on my laptop and connect by phone for the audio or the picture freezes up ALOT! Sometimes the audio stops when the video freezes and sometime it doesn't. I use zoom to provide mental health services and I just can't have that. Waiting for the program to start working again and trying to figure out how much was/wasn't heard is not a good use of time when time is very limited. It works much if I don't use the audio through my laptop.	838
REVIVE CHOR	2021-07-08	5	Nice app but today in my account there is connecting problems there is showing antil ((CONNECTING...)) But not connecting I AM REQUESTING TO ZOOM APP COMPUNY TO RESCUE MY ZOOM ACCOUNT (((PLEASE))üò£üò£üò£	0

Vijya Laxmi	2021-06-26	4	It is a very good app. My school is using this app only for teaching online. All the features are very good in this app. I could have given it 5 stars but I am giving it 4 because of the 2 problems I face. Problem 1:- Whenever I try to sign up it always shows you are not eligible to sign up for Zoom at this time. Problem 2:- Whenever I try to download the stickers it always shows retry every time. If you solve these it would be very greatful of yours. With regards Vijya	1744
Nutan Singh	2021-07-08	1	Very bad,worst app video quality is very poor audio is very poor every host's video is poor and consumes a lot of data plzz don't download it and use Google meet instead of this worse app...	0
FOJLI RABBY	2021-06-21	1	Everything is ok jst one problem is that when teacher is showing something in blackboard and inmiddle if someone unmute his /her speaker then his /her profile comes infront of screen and we r unable to see the blackboard . But we can see the board again if the teacher speaks again. I would recommend to the zoom authority that wheather the person who is speaking should be shown with writing ,such as Ram is speaking... but the video shown by the teacher should be continued . Ex sm.as meet app	0
Mamta Kumar	2021-06-15	4	Good app for free meetings. But I want so say something that if the host has locked the meeting room, the second person who is trying to join the room, should not be thrown out of the room. Zooms owner should make a waiting page for the participants who are trying to join the room and the names and profile pictures should be shown to the host that someone is trying to join. But it's a very good app. Thanks for reading my review.	1453
Tr Spear	2021-06-27	4	Love Zoom! I would like more android phone options, but even without an account, it is great for meetings: For Scarlett's problem, turn your video off then back on and it will reset. For the microphone, you may need to install an update on another system. I had that problem when I needed to update my Google and also dropped my phone & had to use an earphone with a microphone.	1867

Sambhram L	2021-06-27	1	Zoom it's not worthy of getting even 2 stars. Features of zoom:- The video lags every time, even if the internet connection is good. It consumes more data. It alone uses 1gb per day. Even if the video quality is worst it uses more data. It consumes more battery usage. In which app will you get these amazing features all in one The worst app I have ever used. More than this, I prefer to MS Teams. Google meet is far better than this.	2
Dr ramswaroop Markam	2021-07-01	2	I want to give it 5stars but problem is when I delete it and then re-download it dosend download and sometimes it says app is not supported for this device plz fix it and plz make a system of virtual background at mobile/tab alsoüôèüôè	0
Henry Paul	2021-05-28	3	Recent app updates have introduced quite a numer of issues. First, when a zoom meet is in going on, the sound from all my other apps starts acting strange. If I want to listen to music in the background, I can't because the sound is greatly altered(for the worse). Secondly, I have started facing issues in connecting my TWS to the mobile. It takes a number of tries to successfully connect. I wasn't facing these issues earlier. Expecting you to solve these issues.	13

Melvis D'sa	2021-06-23	2	For those of you, who need an app for meetings, I would suggest to use Google Meet; as it is much better than Zoom. One main problem about Zoom is that after a certain time limit, the meeting will get cancelled by itself, with a message saying that your free meeting is ended....or something like that. Even though the host has not ended the meeting. And this has been happening for 2 days in a row now. Also, its a bit difficult to use in comparison to Google Meet.	712
Ramesh Karki	2021-07-09	2	It is good but sometimes bcz of zoom I'm missing classes and after updating too it's not useful . If this will happen then I'll be uninstalling this app . And I suggest not to download, download if it is too compulsory.	0

Preethi Sharma	2021-07-08	4	Good app,I liked it so much it hasa nice features in it but it has lot of issues such as network problem, bluur voice and bluur photos etc..... So I am giving it 4 four star app is good but need improvement in it. It is so good that we can add our profile pictures and we can do our personal mettings with friends and family etc.. In this pandemic time this app is nice that we can take meetings everyday with our parents, grandparents and friends to take care of them. Nice app but need improvement.	1010

Jonathan King	2021-06-21	4	"Works pretty well Few points: 1) A couple of features missing in Android: seeing more than 4 people at a time, etc. 2) Why having removed the ""MutedVSNotMuted"" flag when seeing you own card? Now, you need to activate the toolbar to check if your microphone is muted or not... Before you could see it by just looking at your own card during a call 3) Annoying to be logged out mid-day (24hrs since last connection). You usually find out just when joining a call that you need to log in again."	941

Also it cut out time from time if that could stop it would be great thanks.	61

Many health related problems are arising to students ...such as headache,eye sight problems etc... As a student i personally think that u should reduce ur time limit for session instead of 45 min keep it for 20 minutes session. One more please do one change to relating to joining single person that he should not be allowed to attend more than 2 meetings. Please.... Thanks.....	1
Varsha gupta	2021-07-02	5	This is very good and important app to take online classes and they have many features Ex chat raise hand and etc I love personal chat in this app I am giving to you 5 starüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü	0
Claire	2021-06-24	2	"The app isn't working right now on my tablet, whenever I click ""Launch Zoom"" nothing happens, I hope his is temporary and you can fix it, this is the first time I've experienced this, I've been using this since maybe March 2020. It was a 5 star before both on my laptop and tablet, now 0 star on tablet. Thank you & God bless üôè"	818
Prakash Shete	2021-07-02	1	My mobile is 1 plus 7 meeting is only preparing but not connect. Several times tried, very nurvous, so many times demand help but not reply.	0
jyoti Sinha	2021-07-08	1	It creates a lot of problems for me . Most of the times I am not able to enter in meeting it shows connection error .	0
Kumari Weerasekara	2021-06-11	3	Actually a nice app, and all functions are working properly. But l think it's better if the basic users of zoom mobile app are also giving the opportunity to record the meeting. Pro version is also letting to only record one's own meeting, it do not allow us to record any one else's meeting with the permission of the host. So requesting to provide the recording option for basic zoom mobile users too.	1789
Ahmad A.	2021-06-13	2	EDIT: For some annoying reason, Zoom's audio output selection is a hit or miss when my Note 8 is connected to either my Bluetooth headphones or my vehicle's Bluetooth. If I join a Zoom meeting when my phone is already connected to my vehicle's Bluetooth, it plays the meeting over my vehicle's speakers. But if I'm heading out of the home/office with a meeting already ongoing on my phone, it doesn't switch to my vehicle's speakers! To make matters worse, if I get a call out of nowhere in the middle of a meeting, Zoom randomly never reconnects to my Note 8's built-ing speakers nor Bluetooth headphones/speaker, & the Zoom Android app doesn't give a clear choice for forcing audio output to a specific device. Fix this dreaded problem! Also, it's been a while now and I still can't initiate Zoom Meeting recording on my Note 8! What gives? My Note 8 easily streams live screen recording to YouTube, Zoom is nothing more tasking. Heck, there are 3rd-party apps that enable this function on my phone, so, there's no excuse why a 1st-party solution can't be implemented. Please implement this ASAP. B4: Amazing video meeting app that just keeps getting better and better! Please improve support for DeX Mode and add Virtual Backgrounds support on Android 9 and up devices like my Note 8. Thanks.	299
PARTH BHAARTIYA	2021-07-08	1	Zoom meeting is not connecting since 7 days everytime comes network problem i download a video in 1080p in just 10 sec at speed of 10 mb per sec	1

Satyam Agarwal XII B2	2021-07-01	3	Don't know why but suddenly the meeting ends up by itself and automatically gets rejoined in another second . It becomes a embarrassing moment for the user who is in a meeting or class. If it's a bug then please fix this . Or tell me a reason so that i can fix it from my side .	0

JK Collections	2021-06-21	4	This app is a wonderful app. It's updating very good. In the new feature we can make a channel and chat with friends. This app can be used without signing in also.

Please update it.	335

Patrick Pomfrey	2021-07-07	4	The only reason I Give it 4 stars instead of 5 is there is not clear enough instructions how to connect other people to your meetings	0
Mitali Bhanja	2021-06-12	3	This app is great for meetings and regular calls or just chilling with friends. This app works perfectly fine on the phone. But when i tried to share my screen on my iPad, i got to know that screen sharing is only available for IOS devices with 11.0 and above. This disappointed me. It would be great if zoom would create an option to share screen for old iPads too. This would make people's life easy with IOS below 11.0. I hope someone from zoom is reading this!	973

Alisia Childress	2021-06-26	2	Was working ok enough on my android tablet. Then out of nowhere the microphone stopped working. Went through all the trouble shooting, but nothing changed. And contact support just takes you to a useless page where you don't actually contact anybody. Doesn't give you any sort of help if none of the troubleshooting steps do anything. And my microphone works just fine testing it outside of the app.	487
Gyanaranjan Behera	2021-07-09	1	Instructing the zoom app is very good but now it is not properly use or work when I connect to my teachers it is so that it is not connecting or reported problem or ok are anything else but is starting the jhoom I am fast installing it is very good but now it is not good why why why... ...... ........................‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶*.........‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.	0

Suzanne Norton	2021-06-11	5	I love Zoom! It has made all the difference during the pandemic. I've used it for work to do story times for children, teach exercise classes, and for virtual dance parties!!! I have attended amazing webinars, writing groups, and one on one instruction with my beloved Tai Chi teacher. I have been able to enjoy so much creativity, including hours of fun using my own photos for virtual background. I covered my bedroom walls in green paper for my green screen and studied up on sound and lighting.	846
Readus Salehin	2021-06-26	3	The buttons are very laggy. When I click on the buttons it takes 2-3 seconds to respond. And when the zoom control panel disappeared, I tapped on screen to open the control panel. I've tapped multiple times but the control panel doesn't appears.	0
Vasavi Solleti	2021-07-01	4	I gave 4 star because it uses more battery and our phone,laptop,tablet are getting heated after the usage of zoom . My computer too have zoom cloud meetings app and it is also producing more heat.	3
Woody Water	2021-06-16	3	Enjoyed using zoom until the recent update knocked out my microphone-- I can hear others at meetings, but they can't hear me. Microphone works well in other apps, but NOT in zoom, so i know my 1-yr old tablet is NOT broken! Please fix this bug so I can enjoy zoom again! UPDATE: there was a bug in the zoom app for an entire week & now it's fixed! Many thx to those who listened and made the repair-- you kept a customer!	148

Nirbhay Chand Thakuri	2021-06-16	3	This app is a 50/50 for me it has some good as well as bad finctions. The good function is that we can easily have more than a dozen of peoples together in a single video chat, where as bad side is that we dont have more than 40 mins of time in the clouds. We can easily add anyone in the meetings but the joining process is really headache because sometimes it just dont open the app or sometimes the correct password is said to be wrong and so on. This app will neither let you down nor make happy.	985
yaa	2021-07-08	1	There is a lot of network issue. I am totally not able to join the class. Fix the error code.	0
Big Rocket	2021-05-21	2	This app gives a lot of video lag and dropped audio, so I tried using the app for video and dial-in for audio, to reduce bandwidth. That worked somewhat okay, but here's the problem. When you call in, you have to enter a really long meeting number and a passcode, and Zoom gives you only 10 or 15 seconds to enter the very long meeting number. If you're unable to quickly enter the meeting number, Zoom kicks you off the call. Come on! Please give us more time to enter the info.	4020

Diana Reynolds	2021-06-29	5	Zoom has come a long way, having worked out a lot of the kinks. There are still a few glitches in the video here and there, probably due to internet throttling. The audio is much better than in the past, especially when playing music. Overall, it is such a convenience for business meetings and personal get-togethers and is so easy to use.	1166

My PC is about 5 yrs old and it was pixilated and delayed.	593

Damon	2021-07-02	3	Reall good video application but I guess there's an issue while sharing the link. If an meeting host disable to share the invite link by thr participants , we can still share the meeting through the ongoing meeting's drop down info box. We can copy and share the link, meeting id, meeting password through there. This can be the main reason of zoom bomb. You can look through it to solve this issue or bug.	30

Rabi Malik	2021-06-23	1	This app doesn't deserve even a single star. All apps run smooth on internet expect this so called ZOOM. Moverover, it should be named as BATTERY EATER as it consumes a lot infact all battery. Sometimes vedio is paused and sometimes audio is distorted. This app runs very slow on internet and I can't capture screenshots. I miss screenshots mostly. There should be a button to capture screenshots but isn't.	189
Emily P	2021-04-26	2	It's much more convenient, quick & easy to click the link on my device and then use smart share on the TV. There are more than 4 of us it messes with the app if we all have to get on individually, but the app doesn't allow the sound to transfer to the TV! Can't hear a dang thing going on but we can watch it just fine. We've tried different options to work with the sound, the app won't allow.	6540
Tim Owens	2021-06-15	4	Works very well, however, I wish I could mute/unmute my microphone using the in-line controls for my wired headset. The same button I use to answer/hang up a call or to play/pause, I wish it would work to either toggle mic mute or work as push-to-talk. Please implement this for moble. If it gets this feature, I will award 5 stars.	748
D M	2021-05-25	4	This app started out really great for a little over a year. It began freezing about a month ago and since then it just keeps getting worse. There's no way to update the app on my phone which is the only place I use it. I tried contacting support only to get a auto reply so I cleared cache, cleared data, forced stop, and uninstalled the app. Reinstalling it now to see if that clears the issue. Will post an update. Zoom may want to consider providing updates for their apps on cell phones.	1389

Kirill	2021-06-24	1	Attention: fraud alert! With a paid subscription, an automatic payment is enabled, which does not depend on your desire. Money is debited without warning and is not returned back. The support service is formally available, but does not respond to requests. Zoom might look like a solid multi-billion dollar business, but in reality it is just a bunch of small fraudsters.	883

Moses Prem	2021-06-23	2	Nice app. But I expect to be the better app. While I am seriously focusing on the meeting if someone talks or discuss, their profile hides the Host from the screen which is really irritating. Let the other people discuss or talk it doesn't matter but their profile pic hides the Host's Presentation in the Screen while they talk. Fix this problem Asap. Thank you..	261
Sneha Kongari	2021-06-18	3	The Zoom App is comfortable and easy to use for all but the problem of imposters or unwanted guest entering and disturbing should be maintained as this is a very big drawback of this App. This App could have easily got five stars from my end but this big demerit has got into my nerves. Why can't that device be block once the user(imposter) is removed from the session, so that he/she could not carry on such activities through that device. Plz fix it.	888
Tomy Jose	2021-06-11	4	We greatly appreciate the service and various functions of Zoom. We teachers are able to use it extensively for our classes. One improvement we teachers need very much is the provision for breakout rooms in iPads and Android version. The 40 minute time cap on the base version is a major discouragement for smaller groups which are switching to Google meet And other similar apps in mass. Instead Zoom could put a cap on the number of participants. Thanks	101
Vijayalaxmi Avula	2021-07-06	1	Why I given I star means there is network issue.how to keep background don't know that's why you show the keep virtual background option then I will give 5stars üëç	0
Shivesh K Vickneswaran	2021-06-30	3	Ok. Amazing app, but meet can host 250 participants for unlimited time, but zoom c√†n only host 2 participants for unlimited time, and hundred participants for 40 mins for free. And, no Virtual Backgrounds in Android! According to my friend who is an Apple user, virtual Backgrounds, video filters are on their iPad! Please resolve this issue... This is the only reason a whole star is dropped out on this latest edit.	217

Gunja Singh	2021-06-28	5	I like this app, but there is a small problem that the background is not clear it comes on our face but it's nice app. Everyone should know that from how hard work these types of apps are made so I have no problem with this difficulty because this app is not for background it's for attending meetings. Peoples are saying that they can't sign in I also can't sign in in my phone but I can sign in my laptop and desktop	142

Harsh Kumar	2021-06-10	2	The application does what it's meant to do and supports the desktop application perfectly. The only issue is battery consumption in Android systems. I can't have a meeting for more than 2 hours on my phone cause the battery is drained. Please fix this and make the android application less battery hungry.	32
THE TECHNICAL NABH YT	2021-07-08	3	Its is a very good App but its has some bugs that I don,t like that it's connecting problem is the worst problem so please improve it	0
Village Life	2021-06-22	5	The app's main selling point, at least to the broader consumer world, is that it offers free, 40-minute conference calls with up to 100 attendees. It's easy to use ‚Äî people don't need a login to access a meeting ‚Äî and the interface is relatively intuitive. However, those same features put people at risk.	99

UMAR SIDDIQUI	2021-05-13	2	The app works well and without any interruptions. But I'm still unable to use this app with Bluetooth eatphones. This is very serious since new mobile phone are getting rid of the headphone jack and in that case Bluetooth is a must. Whenever I join a meeting with Bluetooth earphones,it works well for 2 minutes and then it starts lagging. Please resolve this issue before it's too late.	7251

Jesse Turner	2021-06-10	5	Heres a tip for anyone who seems to be having trouble with not being able to have the choice to record your sessions during live facetime via it be between family members such as loved ones who cant travel... which makes it harder to connect altogether. Or perhaps you & your colleagues need to talk about pressing issues in which having some form of documentation is pertinent. While Zoom doesnt provide you with a recording option many background screen recorder apps are available to help out.	40
Madhur Saini	2021-06-28	1	It's very very very irritating app. I had opened my data and my network was too good then also it didn't allow me to join the meeting and it was very important meeting. It doesn't have much features in mobile but in laptops it works faster and we can record, add background in laptops. So so so bad. Iam so angry with zoom.	262
Epic bro pro	2021-07-07	1	I give 1‚≠ê because We can't connect to meeting because of your service we have good network but can't connect to meeting Please fix this problem Or this thing will be viral in social media Thanks for your time.	0
 ú·¥è…¥·¥á è  ô·¥á·¥á	2021-06-23	1	When I am in a call with my friends, it kicks me out almost every 5 minutes, when I share screen it kicks me out of the meeting immediately! When I send images they never send and stay at 100%, and my wifi is perfectly fine. Sometimes my messages can't even be sent somehow...? Please fix this.	31
Em 46th President of the United States	2021-06-10	1	Audio & video fails, reboots, having to reset my filming, shutdowns, lost connections - all constantly, every minute or so; garbled metallic voices, black screens - all of this over the course of four nightmare hours. Missed all parts of my meeting but picked up few words here or there. Missed out on my speaking engagement as no 1 could hear me apparently. On my laptop, attempting Zoom shut down Microsoft, e-mail addresses, errors on everything. App won't install, hyperlinks broken. Utter mess.	89
Sherry B	2021-06-21	5	Simply a really good app. functions very well and is not complicated to use. I started using the zoom app March 2020 continually to this present date June 2021. I have nothing negative to say or report because there have been zero problems. An excellent tool for meetings and socializing.	142
Rick Rodman	2021-06-20	2	Video looks good, but sound is very low volume, esp on bluetooth. No way to make it louder. (edit) Uses huge bandwidth. Needs explicit FPS reduction setting for slow connections. Also, app doesn't give any feedback when buttons are tapped, so it feels even more sluggish than it actually is (amd it's very sluggish).	40
Veena ukirde	2021-06-19	4	New zoom not link because in new verzn zoom app person pic showing very small screen and And I think it would be nice if the zoom amp made the duration of 40 minutes at least one to one and a half hours better and more people would be attracted to zoom and use zoom more. Due to the shorter meeting duration, many people are using other meeting apps instead of Zoom. As the meeting duration is less than one hour, it cannot be given a five star rating. otherwise zoom app best in all meeting app	71
Emanuel Makarius	2021-07-02	4	I am the host, but can neither use my personal account when i start meeting nor I can't join the meeting as it say the meeting has been ended by the host! If these issues are resolved u'll deserve 5 stars rating!	2

Gajendra Singh	2021-07-09	2	Before the last update the app was good but after updating it it was various types of problem. Most biggest problem is that the connecting the meeting. Due to this I am unable to do my classes. Pls do something fast	0
Shreyansh Srivastava	2021-07-09	1	Worst app ever exist. Being a student from XII science I need to attend all my classes regularly on time and this hell app made its all possibilities to make my onilne classes worst. Even when my network was at full speed approx 10mbps, it took around 15 to 20 min to connects. Not only me but also my friends too found this a disaster. Still we had to face this idiotic app which is of no use at all. I used to get words from my teachers for joining late but it was all because of this zoom app. ü§¨	0
Shabnam Kumari	2021-07-07	2	It is a good app but why zoom don't include virtual background in phone .poor people can't afford laptop and pc .	0
Nakul Koli	2021-06-23	4	This app is excellent for online classes I use this app from 1 year and there is no glitches and bug. I love to use this app for video calling and online classes but, I suggest to ad the feature that we can message the host or co-host to take us in the meeting, sometimes the host do not see the waiting room and the participants remain in waiting room. So please ad one option that participant can chat with host or co host so they can request host to take them in meeting	83

D R	2021-05-30	1	I don't get it. It's not revolutionary. It's not especially intuitive or easy to use, and it's a greedy cash grab; the plans are either criplingly limited (basic: Clearly intended to force you into buying a paid subscription) or absurdly expensive. ($200 is the least expensive option... Ouch... No thanks.) How did this become the standard?	6541
Biplab Bothra	2021-06-17	5	It's a great application for tutors teachers and other professionals. Some amazing features but few suggestions to make it still better and evolve as best 1. Stopping impersonation problem, get customers identification details phone number should be must, so it's easy-to-identify impersonator 2. White board annotation is difficult on certain devices such as OPPO A31 4 GB 128 GB as well as Samsung F12. Annotation works well on Jamboard, please look for updates	84
Ritik Raj	2021-07-07	1	This app is really very worst.A lot of problems is taking place in this app.Everyday we get disturbed becz of network issue.

Clessandra Pippenschnott	2021-05-02	5	"So far, so good. Edit after using for 2 months: Works really well and cant complain. Hope they find a source of revenue but dont look forward to when the subscription and poor free service starts. Reminds me of Skype, back before they got full of themselves. I suppose you cant leave well enough alone? Thanks for the use I've gotten, to date! Good Job! Edit after 1 year: Great App and a bargain. Hope the prices don't increase too fast without a ""tiered"" option. Again, Thank You."	5619
Shilpa B	2021-06-26	3	Virtual background issue: I gone through several reviews about virtual background in zoom app but all are stating that one cannot be able to set the virtual background in an android which doesn't have Snapdragon processor. I don't have Snapdragon processor. But I'm in critical need of virtual background [my zoom app is up to date(version: 5.6.7(2173)] So I want a quick solution to this problem.	170
Shivani Padhi	2021-06-24	1	This is the worst app I've ever seen, it worse then teams app, even WhatsApp video call has good quality. It's mic and camera has many problems. It's so complicated, you won't when your mic is on and people listening what you're talking to your parents and family. It consumes so much data, it will stop working 5 times in 5 minutes. Honestly, if I could I would slap the developer and designer of this app. I recommend you, if you don't want your meeting to go smoothly, never ever use this app.	92
Lightning Samurai	2021-06-11	1	I tried tried registering and was supposed to get a verification code, but never did. I gave my email as well. Edit It would be nice if it allowed to pick up sounds from 2 different rooms. Example When me and my music teacher were recording ourselves, the recording only picked up up 1 of the sounds, which was when I was singing.	848

K.P.Meeran Mohideen	2021-06-27	3	Your latest version 5.6.7 is not compatible for Alcatel A3 Tablet it seems. While connecting remote person could not hear voice when the video is ON. If the video is switched off voice is very clear. The same not happening with other online class apps. Since the kids are attending online class from home, i request to continue the support for all older version Android till we come out of pandemic situation.	107
Arnav Kumar	2021-06-15	3	The experience of using the zoom is great, to gives a quiet good platform of attending classes and official meetings in Times of solitude. But the problem I am facing is that I can't sign in /sign up in the zoom website. I am hoping the zoom services to concern in this matter. Thank you	0
Satyam Waskale	2021-06-22	3	That very useful app. But there is problem related to chatting. When I message a friend directly, he goes away to everyone all by himself, it sometimes bother me most . I request you to please fix this problem.	0

SUBHASH BANISETTI	2021-06-21	2	It's ok. Not much better. Its is consuming more data. And the main problem is when allowed to ask video preview before joining the meeting it is not displaying. Its the one thing which is really problematic for me.	4

JOYKUMAR NONGTHOMBAM	2021-06-19	4	Hello Sir, I'm using your app ZOOM CLOUD MEETING since last two years. It gives me satisfaction but I need an option to set number of videos that I like in mobile. It shows only 4 videos in mobile screen at the same time. Please allow us to see more than than ten videos simultaneously as it seen at the computer's  monitor screen. If you upgraded this option, I'll thankful to you and your team. Thanks.	74

T A	2021-05-12	1	Recently I have been having issues with the audio. Everytime I use the app it corrupts the audio on my phone. I have to turn off and turn on my phone again to make it normal. I chooses to make the audio go through the ear piece hole instead of the normal speaker which is annoying. I tried many other apps and only when I use zoom it happens. I don't know if you can fix	1403
aleish m	2021-07-05	5	Good! . But its much better if they have an option for background even if you only use cellphone. Thank you	1
sabre stars	2021-05-26	3	This is a perfect app. I've been using it for about 1 in a half year or 2 years, after a while it started lagging, never got into my meetings (there important) started struggling with that for 1-2 days. It lags too much. Please update ur app and make it not lag, its a pretty good app in general. Please update ur app as soon as possible before its too late, I think it lags for us all, either way its a pretty good app and I would recommend you to use it or try it! It's better in general tbh.	31
TechTiPs	2021-07-03	2	Good for study. But user interface is very simple and many of important features like more camera options/filter and customisation of meetings are unavailable. We can't record meetings either in piad version. Even there nothing basic features of pc version are available in android version, thats disappointing. Actually the app looks made for Android older version *lollipop*üôÑ...*My opinion* if u r student and only need this for attending school classes then go for it, either many other options.	31

Infinity Star	2021-06-18	4	All the things are good at all. But, I can suggest some improving feature for this app (as for students in online classes). 1st is that there is read reciept for massages (as in whatsapp) sent to chat section in meeting. 2nd is that a popup notification while a massage recieved in chat section (used when audio connection is poor). 3rd is (if possible) that the video resolution selection for all members except (or not) the host.	84

Thanku for making such a get app	92
Jos reedy	2021-06-26	4	Wish that opening chat didn't interupt video feed otherwise it would get 5* **Edited** Chat/video issues have been patched however there are other comms aps still doing it better. A floating keyboard so you can message without losing sight of the person you're talking with. Why is multipin not standard? Pop-out your cam so you know what face you're showing at all times. Calls would be much better organized by custom layouts.	48
BASS BOOMERS	2021-06-24	2	Zoom cloud meeting is best in terms of its features (here not talking about pc /desktops) I have an android phone the main problem is that while I switch towards another app or link and zoom gets in the background. my video turns off. issue is that during the time of test or exam Google form links are been shared in zoom chat so by clicking it zoom gets in background and my camera or video turn off which leads for canceling of test . Pls do solve the problem by any update or so that video kepson	32

SURAJ KUMAR SINGH	2021-06-25	5	Hello sir we have used your app and we like it very much. You have a lot of functions and we like all those phones very well. But sir, we have found a small flaw in this. Sir, the shortcoming is that when we are on the computer on the laptop, when we do the meeting, when we are in the post. How to be a participant even on the computer, then we get the function of recording the meeting but it is available. Why not in butt mobile then sir I request you to please give us the function of record	74
Ketheesh Loganathan	2021-05-22	5	I started using zoom recently and I didn't get any problems until now, there are a lot of options when using the zoom app. There is a good connection and less data is used. And your new update is also so superb. Mostly I like the immersive view. It is Soo cool. The only error I found was there is only 40mins if there are more than 3 participants	373
Dali Bo Furnell	2021-04-29	3	Sometimes the app gives problems and it can definitely improve. And I wish it used less data. But it is an extremely convenient way of communicating and having virtual meetings when you cannot all be in a physical meeting! It helps to stay in touch, stay informed and gives one less excuses as to not to attend an important meeting!	2353

And it's nice and very much good app for meeting and nice experience.	0
Azi Ali	2021-06-28	4	The reason I gave it 4 stars is when I am in middle of a meeting it diconnects even if the Network is working and it says error and I even checked all reasons why a meeting disconnects and what should I do but there is nothing wrong with mine..And also when The host is about to say the special part of the meeting the crystal clear Sound goes like it's in slow-mo I think you should fix this problem	15
Kanishk Saha	2021-04-23	5	Good app. It is very useful more as I really do love this app! It has everything I needed. Just, this needs a update which is loss for you but if you not make the update it is also fine for me. You have made that 3 participants ( including host ) and it ends after 40 minutes. It is annoying and we need to rejoin. Please do fix and make it unlimited. The special feature is not adverts. Thanks for a great app, wishing you a happy day ahead!! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT APP. MY DREAM WAS TO GET THIS APP.	1533

Thank YouüôÇ	1
Linda Langos	2021-06-04	1	100% failure. Phone contact matching did not find a single contact with zoom (out of thousands of contacts, some of which I know to use zoom!!!). Then, sending a contact invite, no email was ever received by the recipient (yes they did check the spam folder! Yes we tried several times!). -> For me it does not work on my new Samsung galaxy active pro running Android 9. The one and only good news in all this time-wasting is that I did not buy licenses for my company. Never believe the hype.	1155
Anita bodh	2021-07-02	1	Very bad experience with new version of this app. Audio part is worstüò¨üò°.

Christine K	2021-06-14	1	Revlry+ Android, while trying to get on weekly meetings on Wednesdays with Juice Plus+, I'm a rep, cannot get any sound. While testing with my small group, sound works well. Conclusion: if group had mute for all members, it will not allow some the ability to receive any sound. Works well on computer but I need the versatility of being able to use my phone while on the go. Would give a 5 if not for this. JP+ is my income and I NEED to keep in touch with my team.	584
Aryman Pathak 9th 'B'	2021-04-24	4	This app is very good. I could have given it a 5-star rating if it not had been for one thing. Whenever we join a meeting on a mobile device, it always asks for our meeting name when we join the meeting and it has started, even after we have entered our name while entering the meeting ID. I request you to pls remove this feature.	1789

Anna Grams	2021-05-04	5	Of all the video conferencing apps I've had to use this past year, Zoom is the best. Others have been glitchy, complicated, or of poor quality. Zoom is user friendly, can be used across all platforms, and scales easily for all group sizes. Plus, it's incredibly intuitive for non tech savvy users. It beats Microsoft teams' clunky, unintuitive user interface and poor transmission quality hands down. Great app all around!	2596
Simi Bharali Devi	2021-06-15	1	The reason of this one star is quite clear..... It's a malfunctioning voice over media.... There's so many bugs and breaking glitches. It always creates mic issues and just creates a mocking environment throughout the meeting. Therefore we have to be soo stealthy for the business. Hope this all problem and interface gets fixed for a better voice over experience!	151

Mandy Richardson	2021-06-09	5	Great for meeting up with friends during this lockdown period. I'm pleased that I can use it on both my mobile phone and tablet. However I have been having problems with the app on my tablet because it says that it's not optimised for my tablet. I've been able to hear my friends, but they haven't been able to hear me. You have got two more apps that I found. One is called Zoom Room Controller and the other one is called Zoom for Intune. Which one should I use instead of Zoom Chat.	1084
Christine H	2021-05-22	5	This app is good for meetings, school, virtually catching up with long distance friends, and other appts. Zoom has made life much easier, less stressful, less physical pain while recovering from surgery. I don't have to drive amongst the dangerous drivers on torn up roads & freeways, plus it save a lot of $$$ on gasoline. What else can I say? I really like this app, you can save the zoom meeting for later to review it, take notes, transcribe it, or share it. It's easy to use & no commercials!	1025
Santosh Pawar	2021-07-02	4	This app is really good and I love this app very much. But this app has audio problem and sometimes audio stop coming . And it happens when network is full no issues. So plz slove the audio problem as soon as possible. Thanks üëçüèª	1

Roselyn	2021-06-13	3	As a matter of fact zoom app is very useful for official and unofficial meetings as well as for calls. However I will be glad if it is made user friendly and has SPEAKER OUTüîä options. Thank you.	5
geetika das	2021-06-13	5	I really like this app. It's cool that you can do a meeting with up to 100 people! But tbh it's not cool that you have to update it almost always bc when I do my classes and need to get in, it doesn't let me in just because I have to update it! but it's rlly nice anyways.	75
Ratnabahu Das	2021-06-30	4	Nice applications to communicate other.. Please ad option desktop view, like YouTube has this option.	0

Dylan Kerr	2021-05-21	1	"I used to love zoom, found it very useful. Then I encountered a sign-in error that the company just couldn't help me with. They were so apathetic in their way of ""helping"" making terrible suggestions that I knew wouldn't work. I'm a paying customer for their service and they just treated me with complete apathy, you can only talk to them via chat app and email and they are so useless. They talk to you like you are bothering them and they see no sense in urgency in trying to help."	798

h f	2021-05-03	1	Rubbish... Not a great picture, had a 3 way conversation with relatives in Oz and Spain, I'm in UK. Had to reset it 3 times too get a decent sound connection. Only one person can talk at a time and you can only talk for 40 mins then you have to PAY? WTAF? Are you joking? Then I get millions of emails. Not worth any money, there are lots of FREE apps out there, leave this alone is my advise. Unistalled.	1820
Bernard Chong	2021-06-29	3	Decent app with promise that it fails to live up to. Unfortunately everyone uses it so I'm stuck with it too. They have very few colors and tools available for drawing and their screen share has little to no capability to share audio - which they have known since May and haven't done anything about.	25
Professional Gamerz	2021-07-09	1	Worst app. It's server gets down every week. My son is not able to attend his online classes. Please fix this problem. I wanted to give 0.00 stars. And my son tried to do his online classes in laptop but the same happens in the laptop also . Worst app üò°	0

John Phillips	2021-06-25	5	Zoom has been a good app for communication. I have used it both Nationally and Internatiolally. It works well accross the city and the world (Mid-West US to Korea). Note: You may need a Internet plan with adequate outgoing (UP) bandwidth. -- Many US cable providers have inadiquate outbound bandwidth on many of their low cost plans.	30
Daniel Lui	2021-06-07	1	Why is there no proper grid view when using the app on a tablet (in my case, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+) ? The fact that I can't see more than 4 people at a time and that I have to swipe to the next page to see the other call participants is ridiculous. On the desktop app, I have the option to see everyone all at once in a grid view regardless of how many people are on the Zoom call. Please bring the same seamless functionality to the app.	1749

But after hours of gaming my mobile heats too much but not switches off like that... Maybe like previous allegations zoom is collecting our data by switching off our device and pretending like it's just a technical issue. I want a proper feedback on my opinion	33
Elaine Lewis	2021-06-18	4	Suddenly no one can hear me even though the mic is on, and it has all mic permissions. UPDATE: The issue was caused by the device software update which was not compatible with Zoom. So, simply Uninstall Zoom, then update the device software again, then re-install Zoom. BOOM!	41

Elaine Small	2021-06-25	5	Really got to know thiss app in 2020. I haf never heard of it before then. During pandemic and now its wondrful to be able to see and hear people. On my pad it does consume a lot of power. I love this app.	0

Tammy Doylerush	2021-04-28	2	I usually use Zoom on my laptop. On my Chromebook it is a limited and awkward experience, like using it on an iPad. You can't view in Gallery or Speaker view. The window is a square rather than fullscreen. There are none of the other video options - just on or off. You have to put both a first name & surname in for account. You can't change name once meeting has started etc. I'll stick with laptop.	2632

Joel Rieck	2021-06-30	1	What happened to the buttons to change your picture/name and log out in the 5.6.7 (2173) version of the app on Android? I have personal and professional accounts, and I have to switch between the two frequently. This seems like a bad update.	41
Prakhar Kumar	2021-07-05	3	App is good but only 2 problem I have with this 1. It takes almost 1gb of my internet data in which class is of 45 minutes and 5 periods and 2. It is very annoying because my phone battery is 4000mah and I have to charge it full then only I am able to attend all class and it drains too much battery of mine phone , please fix these issues	6
Atlas	2021-04-27	4	One thing I would suggest, is subtitles. Sometimes, it can be hard to hear what someone is saying, and we misinterpret words, leading us to not understand. Subtitles would be a great addition, because then people that are deaf/hard of hearing can atleast put together sentences when they are on a Zoom call.	1578

Pushpa Agrawal	2021-04-30	4	No adds - perfect Easy controls - perfect But connectivity - OK I would give 5 stars but I didnt because all things are good but there are some error and also Microsoft teams is better than zoom. I can say it because last year I used Microsoft teams only but I like your hard work. By the way, its a experience of a kid and I am only writing this. I suggest you to organize your meetings from zoom. Good job!	1848

They could hear me but not see me at all! I wish I was able to attend the last one it was with my great grandson, he heard my voice but the both of us couldn't see each other. He is one years old, his birthday is coming up very soon and I've been told he is asking for me!	1108
Dushyant Kumar	2021-06-29	4	Suggestions:- If possible please make changes in the app in which it will show timer for every client/participants in the meeting. So that on can know that for how much time the user is connected in the meeting. This will help to reduce proxy in meetings and maintaining descipline and sincerity. Thanks.	15

atheena biju	2021-06-23	5	The video quality is very high compared to other applications....The only drawback of zoom is that we can't use it continuously for more than 40 / 45 minutes....

ananya rai	2021-06-23	1	If i could give this app only half a star, I would. This app on phone and laptop is buggy as hell, goes offline at random times, even when the connection's completely fine.

Derek Rocha	2021-06-18	4	As a director of a program that is using the zoom app to hold its meetings; online, international: with a global perspective on high standards of presentation, a number of staff and teammates, also in the process of achievement of publication, that is otherwise difficult without the expertise of this app. I would like to let you know that I will be recommending you to all of the people in my program.

Shaswata Banerjee	2021-05-30	2	It's true that it came use to continue our studies during COVID period ,but it's server is very poooooooor, that nobody can hear me during class. It is very disappointing. The app is good for keep going on online classes but it must solve its network problems. Last time I said this, but they couldn't improve it. What's happening with Zoom??. SOLVE YOUR SERVER ISSUES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!If you say it's my network problem,then I'll say no;because I never faced this with Google Meet.	3384
Henschel Chongo	2021-05-02	4	This app is very good,it would be awesome if you put an option were the application saves usernames. It is challenging when a multi users only using one gadget and is difficult to see who really is commenting in a meeting. So it would be better if you added an option where you can select different usernames at a particular time. Thankyou.	1186
Ang	2021-06-24	4	I was experiencing what others have--not being able to be heard. I fixed it by opening my app in settings and clearing cache and data. ZOOM must be reading these comments.

Anushka K	2021-05-31	4	It's a really good app. I do really appreciate it. And would love to recommend it to everyone. Just couldn't give all 5 stars because 2 main features I wanted to use wasn't accessible for me. 1. Virtual background enhancement(I use Redmi note 9). 2. Recording feature(please do consider that not everyone is well equipped with laptops and others facilities so please do allow that features to be used in android phones too. It might be very much useful for teachers like me.)	2337

Sassy S	2021-06-28	4	Zoom is great! It could be better. I wish there was a way to go to the Participants List and click on a name and then they pop up on the screen. When you're in a BIG meeting or reunion, you need a way to be able to find a particular person. Then 5 stars can be given.	3
Dr. Nasim Ahmed	2021-07-08	1	Giving this only 1 star coz There is always network issues Even after sitting in a proper network area..	0
Alex Melissakis	2021-06-25	2	It's shameful there is no support for displaying more than 4 users on screen when using a tablet or on Samsung Dex mode. Also the aspect ratio of the camera... Why not able to do 16:9? Why can I mirror the image on my screen but others receiving it not seeing it mirrorred? Developers are making millions and yet leave android tablet users hanging while iPad users get all the desktop like features... Not cool!	11

Rifqi Zauhair	2021-05-21	1	It has the problem during the connection unstable but I'm ensure to use the highly connection speed of WiFi signal. This problem is happened twice. I've already uninstalled for twice and updating the app version. For the moment after the latest version's update, it solved. In my second chance after update, the buggy message of error 5003 is appear again. I hope zoom could resolve this for the user. At least, because zoom is first choice for video teleconferencing. Thanks	793

Justice Chukwuma	2021-07-04	4	I love the app so much. But what dissatisfied me so much is the virtual background. It should be made available on other android device like Infinix and Tecno. I suggest the developers should look into this	2
Poornima Shettigar	2021-07-07	4	Good app. Is it possible to connect audio to external audio(bluetooth speaker)	0
Shiksha Kaushik	2021-06-02	5	Nice app for class. Sometimes the voice is not clear and we exit automatically from the meeting.

Narjis	2021-04-25	3	Hi ZOOM team, I just wanted to say, it's a great app, but I really wanna tell you all to put these features of video panel in android like we have in desktop! Like when a screen is shared I have to swipe so many times to see videos, so if that can be possible that would be great. 2.Pls put the option of Virtual Background in android. 3. In android, in one page we can only see 4 people including ourself only, pls change it to atleast 10 people! These r the reasons I gave ZOOM a 3 stars, FIXTHIS	1216
Jasmeet Kaur	2021-06-26	4	very good app, but the reason why i am giving 1 star less is i am not able to edit my meeting id and i have updated the app also but it is not showing option for editing meeting id . you should fix this issue .üôè otherwise app is good. üëå	5

luckystar	2021-07-05	3	Zoom is excellent video quality but I need virtual background and filters for PC, laptop and Mobile also	0
Rajesh Gupta	2021-06-06	3	Mobile app is having very limited functionalities as compared to desktop version, like changing background and other effects. Also if you could make some mechanism where artificial background is full solid one even in the absence of green background, it'd be great. Rest the app is quite good and easy to use.	1
Seetha Devi	2021-07-07	1	I have updated my zoom app but virtual background option is not at all coming very worst don't install this app.	0
Maxim Tran	2021-04-28	5	Very nice. Able to access meetings very fast and video and sound. Quality are vry clear. Its just this one time when my audio stopped and it needed my username and password of the compiter to fix it. Other than that, its great. This is the best meeting app because you get to detach your audio if you are concentrsting on work and there is background noise. I hate google meet. Keep up the work‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§	155

Lakshyajeet Bhati	2021-04-28	5	Hey! I am using Zoom for 2 years now and the updaes you launch constantly are actually helping me being more productive. But I just have a suggestion for the application. The idea is to add a feature to of messaging the host while in the waiting room in case the attendee wants to convey something like if he is not attending meeting or if he wants some info from the host.	1123
Victor Sandy	2021-06-02	4	This videoconferencing app is nice but one question about the app is very disturbing to me. The question is,why should zoom protect only the data of the paid version and let loose the free version for investigation by different government agencies,as seen on Google's news? Second,am appealing to zoom to allow Android phones other than laptops and others to record meetings and change background. I will so appreciate that. Thanks	1481
vinay chavada	2021-06-28	4	Very useful app but as a student I request you to solve mine problem..it is that only 100 members can join the mitting .. whenever my network lost I can't connect to the metting and I have to lost my lecture ...so please solve this And that's all this app is fantastic and awesome	1
Shatabddi sakshi Nayak	2021-06-09	4	Very nice app .... But sometimes it disconects not because of internet but it show there is some disconnectivity in zoom app. I being a student , i will definitely advice all students to do online classes in this app , as in this covid 19 online classes are going on . This is very best app but i have given 4 stars for dissconnectivity , otherwise i would have given 5 stars. This is a very nice app ..... I like this ... Thank you so much zoom.	1

Santosh Sahoo	2021-04-27	2	"Hello Developers! I use this app for online classes and it works fine but sometimes it just shows the ""Preparing Meeting"" screen and doesn't even ask for password. I know all of you are working hard but can you please fix this problem and yeah, previously it was working fine, this all started after I updated it. Thank You :)"	1354
Stacy Small	2021-06-14	3	I gave it three stars because, for mobile it does not automatically switch to the zoom calls when your another mobile app. So when your playing a game or something you might forget that you have a zoom call to get to and you might miss the meeting.	23
Ashlesha Pandey	2021-07-06	5	It is amazing I have used it almost two years and it has never any problem during my online class meetings	0
Panna dave	2021-07-05	5	Now a days of pandemic this app was very usefull for school meeting friends and collage meeting to this app runs so smooth and easy to use I really like this app so I gave 5 star rating	0
Israel Moreno	2021-06-07	4	Excellent tool for meeting with family and friends. However, there is still room to improve quality in the audio and video areas. I personally leave my device connected, because the power needed to use this app drains my battery quickly. All in all, very simple to use once you become accustomed to the controls. Thanks.	887
Sainath	2021-06-17	3	Their was a problem that someone was coming in meeting by using dummy name and misbehave in class. I was already report about these persons 3 to 4 times but it happened daily by same person with same mobile number. I have good experience except above complaint. This app is excellent and my friends also used it.	19
Sabrina Rahman	2021-07-08	2	There should be an option where Zoom allow anyone to record the classes because sometimes teachers don't provide the lectures and its kind of disturbing to ask the teacher every time to make someone Co-host.	0
Anthony Friend	2021-06-24	1	The app keeps crashing on my LG Boost android phone. I do live in poor reception area. But crashing is worse than buffering anytime. Please look into this or best recommendation of a different phone. God Bless you.	17
Aditya Singh	2021-05-22	1	"When opening PDFs in my phone, it always asks for which app to open with even after setting the default app. That's because the ""Send to Zoom buddies"" option (which shouldn't even appear in the ""open with"" menu) keeps refreshing. (Shouldn't this option be in the share menu? How does this app have 500M+ installs when the devs lack common sense? Or it's there to increase the number of times the app is (accidentally) launched.)"	772
Kasthuri vijaykumar	2021-07-01	5	I love zoom app online class help it I say site also very super tq but only one mistake for zoom app network is very important so please network is very slow okay please	1

Henoc Elysee Cajou	2021-05-27	4	The app is a good app, but i think that you have to allow the app to be reduce on the screen while someone is using it, that will make it easy for a person to use another app like messenger or read a picture, without closing the screen of zoom.	7
Natalia Christina	2021-07-01	1	The last update is really annoying. It keeps missing everytime I try to share screen.	2

Kanchan Kshirsagar	2021-06-30	5	Great app! highly recommended for webinars, online meeting and even online classes. Not as many options as i wanted but settings are quite easy and it does what it is meant to do. Better than other apps of the same field. Audio and video quality is also good.	34
annabel	2021-06-28	3	I'd say I prefer using zooms actual calls but because i have to sign in every time I use it, the call codes and the passcodes, not having like a set room or keeping the chat, it's just easier to use Microsoft teams	0

Big Yazi-The Legendary Taidtian	2021-06-02	4	It is a very useful app for meetings specially during this pendamic. It helped us to remain in touch with our love ones.

Julius Cheng	2021-06-23	3	Seems to have an issue with dropping audio and/or not switching audio between Bluetooth devices. Especially relevant is that it doesn't play nice with Android Auto - when using data and connected, it will not play audio either through the BT connection or on the phone.	21
extreme lerner	2021-07-09	1	They not fixed minor bug but added major bug the rating should be zero we are not able to attend any meeting	0
Michael Dawson	2021-06-18	1	I found Zoom is to complicated for thousands of people to log in or to add things to it, Using WhatsApp I find much simpler and straightforward and also there is no time limitations on it. Simply straightforward to use all around. I personally would give Zoom a thumbs down all the way.	29
stewart fordyce	2021-05-25	1	I find this app increasingly frustrating. I've used mobile phone, Chromebook and laptop and all in their own way have things that let one down.. but all share one thing in common... If you haven't got a decent internet connection, sharing buggers it up for others, sharing is itself a very much hit and miss affair and quite frankly zoom is a masterpiece of that'll -do badly!	100
Guddi Yadav	2021-06-23	4	It is a good app especially for online classes in the present scenario but the thing I don't like is that it automatically signs out and then I have to sign in again. That's why 4 stars. Overall it's good	8

Maitreyee Khobragade	2021-04-24	4	Helpful app for online education. Has many features for conducting the meeting. Audio, video, poll, reactions, breakout rooms are some of the features. Pinning a person is easy. After signing up, the later steps are easy to perform. 'Changing participant name' option is available. The chat option can be used for various purposes like talking about a topic or forasking doubts in the session. Virtual background can be added according to the choice of oneself. costumization options available in ‚öôÔ∏è	264
Restless Gamer	2021-04-28	3	The experience was not good at all, after having a strong WiFi connection it still lags and I am a regular user for this cause I use this for my online classes, the meeting expierence is not at all good, most of the discussion is missed in meeting because of lagging and internet issue..It have many problems like lagging, voice cracking, internet stability etc..Don't go for updates any more but try to update these issues, Except Zoom all other meeting and WiFi calling apps work absolutely fast..	1021
John Paul Abellera	2021-05-14	2	I have problems using Zoom with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 (Android and Samsung DEX): - It does not allow me to record meetings to the Zoom Cloud. - When I share my screen, the other attendees do not see my other windows except for my Zoom window. - It automatically disconnects when I open other windows. - It only allows me to share PDFs and JPGs. Videos, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations cannot be shared.	794
Lisa Drake	2021-06-23	3	Now this app is useless yeah maybe good for having zoom meetings but it's absolutely bad for chatting it's very limited to what you can do if it's managed by a corporation management team for their employees and when you're trying to read messages post or check messages it's just too clutter it's just too you have to scroll up I don't know I just got mix feelings about that but I only use it for work	12
Mathangika Satyendra	2021-06-14	1	I am using this app to my school sessions bcoz of pandemic situation. I bought a new microphone it was working for a week. But after a week the microphone is not working in the zoom app. But it's working in the other apps. Please solve this problem. üôèüôè	168

Ankit Priyadarshan Sahu	2021-07-05	5	Nice work done by zoom. It has overally improved his performance. Thanks Zoom.	6
Trackpad Gamerz	2021-07-08	3	Three star because 1. It takes so much net 2. When net is slow it automatically disconnectes. I hope you will solve this problem,well your camera and mic quality is nice. Thank you	0
Tonyia Guy	2021-06-17	4	I learned how to use zoom during the pandemic on my job. I also use it for my church bible study. It is an awsome way for face to face group communication without being in person. Iv'e also had Doctor's appointments on zoom. Zoom has opened up a new world for face to face long distant communication. Thank you ZoomüòÉ	14
Varshu Parekh	2021-06-19	4	This is a very good for online classes ,but the problem is that there is only space for 100 participants so when I'll try to join the class there will be no space so in next update I wish there should be space for more then 100 participant.	3
New movies or clips	2021-06-15	4	I am a coder and I understand that app can't be perfect so soon but with such a large user base you should keep up with genral problem Like when someone call during the meeting the voice getts disband and we have to reconnect by rejoining the meeting....... It should block all calls.......... Futher more it should have Audio recording system for all without any exception	18
Fox Mulder	2021-06-13	3	It lags and freezes often, the sound stops often as well, and in general it is often hard to hear. Over two phones I've seen Zoom drop us from a meeting and it takes a while to get back on with the same volume issue.	14
Naser Chowdhury	2021-06-24	4	It is a fantastic app I agree .But I cannot set up a profile pic in zoom profile .Please tell me how to set up a profile pic in zoom profile . Thus I have a problem and I could find it solutoin so I give four stars.	0
Panna Lal Karmaker	2021-06-27	2	Zoom was good for few months but after then I am facing serous error codes for any meeting. Even if I start my own room it disconnects me. While screen sharing my friends see what I share after 3/4 secondsüò°.I cannot do any meeting or class with it because it continuously disconnects me from the server andüò°the host cannot even listen to my voice properly and I also cannot listen to them.Even if I listen,the voice is buffered a lot.I use Zoom for school purpose so please fix this issue.	29

Jenn	2021-05-19	1	Really disappointed with this software as only the teachers can record the meetings. As a mother of two special need children that are being treated badly on zoom this is something I would really like to record and show the district. But I'm unable to because zoom favors teachers and the people that host meetings not the people participating in the meeting.	1245
Ashish Maurya	2021-05-05	1	I would really not recommend anyone to waste their storage by installing this app. It is ridiculous. I was not able to enter a very important Meeting even though my Internet connection is good.There is always an error I try to enter a meeting. I tried 7-8 times continuously to enter a meeting but it always gave me a single reply that it's a network error. And by mistake i signed out and when I tried to sign in again I put my date of birth 35year but then also it says I am not eligible to sing up	393
Suraj Varghese	2021-05-01	1	After the new update the app takes time to connect over wifi...it connect fast on an LTE connection that 10percent the speed of my wifi 5ghz connection.... interesting thing is it's working fine on my phone on the same network that's running Android 7 but my phones running Android 11 is facing the issue. So looks like a glitch with Android 11 and the new zoom update. The earlier version of zoom before 5.6.4(1862) was working just fine on Android 11. Would be lovely if this could be fixed	110

Kai	2021-06-18	1	"Ok it's good and what ever but I can connect to the mic , this is very annoying when I want to speak and all it says is ""wifi or cellular data"" when I have both please fix this because I need to be able to teach , learn , or even just voice chat"	36
Rupa Rana	2021-07-08	1	Now it become the worst app for meeting because there are no extra servers while users on thi app are more. And also it takes too much data during zoom meeting	0
Yaswanth Hm	2021-06-30	3	I started to use this application for meetings 3 months back. That time it was working fine. Now if i start to attend meetings, audio is not audible. Worst app.	0
Zenii Ope	2021-06-13	5	Awesome! And am so grateful for the services it provides in this difficult time of this pandemic. It has provided the needed connection to the most important part of my life. My Spirituality. To be able to attend my spiritual meetings virtually, along with some wholesome association virtually, to stay connected with friends and family. Thank you zoom app. Sincerely!	189
Ritika	2021-05-08	2	It's fine neither excellent nor bad . This app is okay but many things need to be improved .For example if we are not sending link ,the another person have to enter whatever it ask but if we are sending link then also sometimes it ask for passcode which I don't like .It takes alot of time to join .We need to pin the screen but it can unpin by its own when we change the screen this is the worst thing about it .But during pandamic it's okay .That is one reason I deleted this app.It takes net alot	1014
Shikha Jha	2021-06-25	3	It's nice experience on zoom. But i think you should add one more feature in this, that is it should allows us to whom i can show my video or who is allowed to see my video. It's my humble request to add this feature as soon as possible.	4
Michael B.	2021-05-07	1	This app is virtually useless for meetings with more than four people, as that is the maximum number it can display at once on Android. You must constantly swap pages whenever someone on a different page speaks. It is so frustrating that my newly arisen need to use Zoom has finally resulted in my making a long-in-coming decision to permanently end fighting with Android's deficiencies, buy something Zoom supports, and consign this device to what it can most effectively be used as: A doorstop.	689
REZAUL KARIM	2021-07-08	1	Its very hard to connect with the host.. And its video quality is very üí©poor	0
Ajit kumar gupta	2021-05-31	1	"Hi Team, I'm a Teacher by profession. It's a bit frustrating for me because of the Audio issue in zoom call. Can you please help me to fix the Audio issue. I'm facing problems during my calls. No one can hear me. I set the ""auto-connect to Audio as WiFi or Cellular Data"" as well but still the facing the problem. Don't understand why it's happening. please help. Thanks"	2021
palak makkar	2021-07-08	1	I hate this app its being problematic from some days i was not able to join a meeting and if its joined it suddenly stops	0
Danger Legend	2021-06-29	2	Worked well for last 15 months. For whatever reason audio has stopped working lately. Sometimes I can get it back by resetting but sometimes it doesn't come back.	2
gargi ghosh	2021-04-27	1	I would have given 5 stars, as Zoom was helping my daughter to do the online classes. But after the updation of the app my daughter cannot hear the teachers and is also missing her classes. Very poor audio and voice always cracks. Kindly see to it. Previously everything was fine. But it is not now.	110
Jonathan Jimson	2021-06-20	3	The app is good enough but it would be nicer to have a tablet version which adds a few features from the desktop version. It is very difficult to understand how the app works when you're so used to the desktop version. Hope you take my suggestion into consideration.	23
Bhargav Chaudhari	2021-04-27	3	The new update has serious problems with headphone connectivity, Pairing with my bluetooth headphones while i am already joined in the meeting won't work,each time I have to rejoin the meeting to listen the audio in headphones, Also, using the app in split screen mode, some other audio is parallely played, the meeting audio stops, In earlier versions, I never faced such problems... Hoping the problem gets solved to the earliest.....	155
Hollie Engstrom	2021-04-22	2	I got this for work meetings. I am not always in the same place so I liked the background features. Unfortunately, that is not a feature that is available for most Android phones. More annoyingly, it took forever to find this information out. You can find instructions on HOW you are supposed to enable it but not that it doesn't work on MOST Android phones.	904
Avinash Choran	2021-06-16	2	This app sucks for not providing a basic feature and that is to pin screen. Everytime someone speaks while teacher is teaching, the screen changes. It doesn't change back to teacher's screen automatically till teachers speaks something. Desktop version has this feature but not mobile version.	19
Frankie Blake	2021-05-06	2	Very difficult to swap from my paid account to my free one and vice versa. Actually it's impossible. There is no facility to do this, no sign out/in option. I scheduled a meeting as host but could not log in to access it, therefore I had to reschedule another one 15 minutes later as date and time were limited. I also emailed myself the link too but still could not access it. Real nightmare!! NB:- I have tried this both on my phone and tablet, neither worked!	211
Bourgeons Taha	2021-05-28	2	They changed the recording settings without warning the users. It started giving sound alerts when you starts or stop recording. This startled many of my students. It also so annoying and distracting. I sent a ticket to the support more than a week ago and no answer. I tried to change my parameters but option to activate or disactivate the sonore notifications was removed.	7
Harsha Dama	2021-07-01	1	There is always a net problem even when there is full range. There a thousands of glitches and it hangs the laptops when other applications are running with a meeting joined. It spotlights wrong person while speaking.	3
Jella	2021-07-02	4	It's a great app but it consumes too much data and battery which can weaken the battery life of our devices (i.e if we keep running it down and recharging constantly). Nonetheless, I really love it.	11
Shipra Ghosh	2021-07-09	1	This app has been having problems for long time ..... can't join normally.....Please renew this app so that I can class well again	0

Pinki Rani	2021-05-10	3	Hi zoom team this app is really good and easy to use but there is a problem. I have bought new Samsung galaxy A32 phone and have installed zoom app in it but the audio and video is not working. I don't know much technical things but it's like it is not compatible with Samsung galaxy A32. Can you guys please fix this issue otherwise it is very nice app and I use it for giving online lessons to my students for tutoring. I hope it will fix. Thanks	831
Brian Wiktorski	2021-06-23	1	All of a sudden started saying I needed an update. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still said same. Go to Google store and doesn't say update is available just to open the app. Was working well but now doesn't function.	17
Ramadevi Medavarapu	2021-07-06	5	It ia a very uesful and nice app with as many as possible features. In one word zoom is a spectacular app	0
rocket 2512	2021-04-23	4	This is a very nice app. It's updates are fantastic. But the problem is we can't keep filters and backgrounds in Android. I tried do it from website of zoom.us and when I host the meeting from there it does not open. Please make an update for Android vertual backgrounds! But it also microphone stops working, I have observed it.	106

Seema Devi	2021-07-09	1	I am using this app from 2 years after the new update it shows only 'connecting' and ther error	0
Jacobo Foster	2021-06-16	1	This app is suppose to bring people together. With the latest update my daughter who is using for school among other 25 children cannot use mic now. I guess we may all have to look into Teams as an option. Repeat what good is a video conference app if you cannot be heard...dissapointing.	38
Matthew McCormac	2021-05-14	4	Works great except the following two bugs which drive me mad: 1. I have zoom installed both on my android phone and windows laptop. Once I answer on the windows laptop, the notification continues until I hit decline on the android phone 2. When I make a regular cellular phonecall on my android phone, zoom call notification plays really loud in my ear when I'm on the cellular call.	684
Loraine Deakin	2021-07-01	1	Would do not accept the verification code it sent to my phone. Checked it over to make sure i wasn't doing something wrong. Tried it on my husbands phone, he had the same issue. Now uninstalled, I'll stick with other video apps in future	2

My phone is vivo v20 , I have reinstalled the app 2 times, restarted the phone 3 times but still can't use the zoom app with wifi connection. Phone is updated with the lastest version. Using the updated version of zoom also. Don't know what should I do.	182

Jim Savage	2021-06-30	3	Still too complex. Vol. not loud. Guidance not sufficient.	0
Raddie CVN	2021-05-29	4	Very easy to use app, great for meetings with alot of options for the host to aid a smooth and uninterrupted meeting. Attendance at meetings can also be taken especially if there's more than one user per device. Chats only last while the meeting is running and clears off as soon as the meeting ends.	3
Laila Beegam	2021-06-30	5	Good app and l did not get background in zoom but in Google Meet the background I get so only that problem any way l am giving you 5 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê	1

karen gabell	2021-06-25	1	I didn't quite understand what this app was and it appears like it's just for business meetings so I downloaded it by error and I can't seem to uninstall it. It just doesn't fit my needs. However it does appear to be extremely helpful with people working from home for families visiting.	20
rama krishnamraju	2021-07-09	4	Very nice app but backgroud should added in mobile also so please add it except that i think all is well and i am lisoning online classes also so pls add background its my request this why im giving ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê stars..	0

Kimmieth Gordon	2021-06-16	3	The reason why i gave it the rating it has is because the messages come in so late for example if i were to send a message to some one the reply would come 6 hours or even a day later can you please fix this its very annoying and defeats the purpose of trying to schedule a meeting.	12
Mohammed Akber Hussain	2021-07-02	4	A very nice app ever when lockdown stsrted then I was scared that how will I study online but thans to zoom company for discovering such a brilliant app ever (zoom app ki jai ho) (zoom app ki jai ho)	0
AldenNotFound	2021-05-27	2	Ok so i downloaded zoom and it seems to be working fine but... this app KEEPS requesting updates when there is no update at all! This app also has buggy service and all the stuff everyone hates! If you're asking: Do you recommend it? Well, to the people who wants to have meetings then i recommend it, however, when you want a clear metting without interruptions, then i recommend other apps.	10

Pragya Datta	2021-06-27	2	I like zoom however it consumes a lot of data though I use WiFi but sometimes my WiFi does not works and I have to depend on my mobile data and I am a teen and as well as a translator so i need extra net as I have to read the raws online so I think zoom app needs to improve Frankly speaking, today only I had a 15 min meeting but it took me 500MB like literally just for a 15 min meeting I had to waste 500mb ,In 500mbi can update my full phone and yeah the subscription pack is too high	15
Albert Junior Mhaka	2021-04-24	5	i love the app, especially for jehovahs witness meetings, it needs a bit more touching up to improve user experience and specific presets that can be set for different types of meetings. but thr host needs more administrator powers as well. its also useful to ensure the app is more user friendly. a simple share screen audio option is needed on android.	150
Bakhrom Norkulov	2021-05-31	4	"Hi there I am Bakhrom Norkulov, a Software Engineer I want to tell u one thing about ZOOM. From my own experience while using ZOOM, I have a bug during usage. It is all about chatbox. Whenever one line of text is written in the chatbox, if the user wants to continue the line by the second line, it is impossible. When I tried to step to the next line, while pressing ""Enter"" button , it will automatically send the message instead of continuing. I hope u will improve it‚úå"	998
Conan Chan	2021-05-29	4	Everything is usable so far, except for the fact that zoom on android cant compare to its IOS counterpart. Many things are lacking such as the amount of participants you can see in gallery view, virtual backgrounds, and screen sharing capabilities (sound cant be shared when sharing screen on android). While it is only PC zoom that can optimuse screen sharing, it should honestly be an inbuilt function as it will affect everyones viewing experience. When resolved review rating may be brought up.	181
Roger Tillman	2021-05-19	5	We opted for the paid version because of the length and time of our videos and recordings. It has its problem days, but I am sure every video chat service does also with connection problems.. but also note the issue is normally with the attendee and their internet connection service provider. Otherwise very happy with the service.	1066
Shibnarayan Chakraborty	2021-06-21	1	This app was once a best app for me during the time period of 2 to 3 days when I downloaded it, but after 2 to 3 days it started consuming my 100% net,So I was not able to work on it. Also it disconnects at between the meeting. Extremely disappointing	21
Yusuf - 1 IV B	2021-06-23	1	Feel like giving it a less than zero rating right now, used to work fine few weeks back, but currently does recognize my audio during meetings on my Samsung tab. Zoom doesn't provide customer care to individual users, only to businesses, so I'm stuck with no solution	36

I request you to please please kindly fix this problem as soom as possible. Thank You !"	92
Diane Lee	2021-04-26	2	It's not as well as you might think. It gets really laggy to the point where you can't hear the person at all. One thing, the camera quality is poor. If one person has bad internet- we all share that internet. It's horrible. I only gave it 2 star because I like the host and sharing screen features.	273
Gursimranjeet Singh	2021-06-13	3	The name of this app is ZOOM, but doesn't have ZOOM feature in it. During my online class I'm unable to see clearly because of NO ZOOM option in it ,even if the video quality is good and good network connection.This is the thing you should work on .Hope you will Improve it .	81
Shivaganesh Shanigaram	2021-06-29	1	While zoom meeting is going on, On the same device when I tried to talk with another person through normal call ,they are unable to listen me.I think there is some issue with the app and microphone. Fix it as soon as possible	9
subhasmita mahakud	2021-07-08	4	This app is quite better than other meeting apps. Also less data required for 40 min. Approximately 250 Mb. So we can continue with other work later with the rest data. Thank you zoom	0

Jeanne Marie Galam	2021-05-08	1	Complicated to use. Every time I sign in, redirects to the web browser then back to the app. When signed in using fb or google account, won't even show my contacts so I can just call them directly. Still have to copy a meeting id and send it via messenger so they can go to the link of the meeting. Most inconvenient app ever.	969
Ramleen Singh Matharu	2021-06-16	1	At first it was very good but when it got updated I face problems like when I join the meeting I can't join it tell me to check my network computer even though I have very good network connection u can't join the meeting.

Ishtiaque Shamim	2021-04-23	4	I used to use Zoom in my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE . The overall performance of the app was very good but recently I found out that my quick dial app gets somehow connnected with this app and I had to call a contact in quick dial mode by this app which it prevents every time as it was the free version.

It sucks cuz I miss alot of what's being said and then have to ask to repeat but then I get thrown out again. It's annoying and I hate that it does that to me. Other than that it's fine.	99
BTS PAK ARMY	2021-06-13	1	Ugh please just fix this issue , it's really a matter of life and death for me üôÇüôÇüôÇas I have to take exams on zoom app and I swear to God, it crashes whenever I go to any other app, it's really so problematic for me as I can't use any other app while during the meeting üôÇüôÇpls fix this ....	604
Heri HL	2021-05-21	4	Somehow still need a quite big quota of mobile internet data transfer for smartphone, may the apps can auto adjust for the smartphone users and pc/desktop/laptop user who might need HD video stream, which smartphones dont have to have, because smartphones are where we users may mobile and the connections are not always stable, so the most important thing for smartphone is the stability of connections as long as good enough (not urgently need the best) video and audio quality.	26
Mehuli Rudra	2021-06-01	5	Recently I experienced a technical problem that I have never before.My meeting password kept getting rejected...I tried various methods to get over this glitch.Uninstalled the app,switched off the device and so on,to no avail.Ultimately I had to enter the meeting with another device,and it worked totally fine.I have no idea what to make of this weird problem.Any advisory words in regards to this issue will be appreciated.Thank you.	253
Dalton Broderson	2021-05-27	3	It's not my first choice. My main issue with the mobile app is the fact I can only see 4 people at once, even on a large screen. This needs to be fixed. Just do what other Android apps do and change the app's layout according to the device's DPI.	7
XYZ 123	2021-06-16	1	Excellent app. But recently having trouble with powerpoint presentation screen share. The thing isn't working sometimes. One of my friends felt so embarrassed during her presentation cuz the share wasn't working. She almost cried.	3
Neha Gupta	2021-05-04	5	It is very amazing app for calls, meetings, online classes,in our school we use zoom cloud meeting app only there us one more thing that i like that it personal chat. In team there are personal chat .but in zoom there are no personal chat . So that our parents take relief . That our kid is not doing some bad things.and the good thing is that it is not hanged but teams hang very much .there are so many complaints from teams but in zoom there are zero complaints Thank you stay safe stay healthy üíì	228
Arush Pangeni	2021-05-06	3	I think it is a good apps . due to the period of pendamic, it helps to join different types of meetings , it is also used as studies basis . there fore it is useable app i give three star due to the problem of low vedio quality and sound system problems . it makes so easier to study and it is not possible to complete courses with out this apps üòäüòäüòäüòä	829
Ene Anuar	2021-06-21	2	Recently since abt 2 weeks ago it says the app is not optimised for my device (I'm using Samsung tablet). It was OK before this. I can log in but the conference room did not launch. Please look into optimisation and compatibility of the app with android devices urgently. Thanks.	18
Namrata Kumari	2021-06-28	3	The video and audio quality are fine but there is one problem that whenever i join any meetings then it shows my mirror video to other particular even after turning mirror videos off in the settings the problem continues. Other than this it's a helpful app for continuing our studies online. Please fix the video problem	9
Aadithye N	2021-06-19	1	Why does this app require mic permission to even function? I just want to listen to meetings. Only ask for mic permission if I try to unmute and speak. That's how other apps do it, that how Zoom on iOS works. Make it the same on Android as well. You don't need my mic access until or unless I unmute.	19
Reena Yadav	2021-07-06	5	Plz make this app more interesting by adding a option of quiz and polls because taking continuous class kids bored to making interest of students in class that's all anything is good but by adding these options of quizzes this will be the world's no. 1 app for meetings	0
vinod nadoni	2021-04-22	1	Sometime It takes lot of time to connect to class session. Sometime Even it dont connect. It says network problem. I checked my network but mobile network was good(1.5mb/sec). Even i run youtube hd video. But zoom app says no network. But when i use wifi, then It connects. Whats the reason behind this. How the developer write the code for network connection?	1074
Shruti Chatterji	2021-04-28	2	So it has been a few months since I have started to use zoom on my laptop. Did not have any issues. From 26th April, the application started freezing. Whenever I try to switch on my camera, zoom stops responding. This has to be a problem with the newer version. Please help me resolve the issue.	61
Hanumant Bhatt	2021-07-08	1	We are not able to join meeting because its server is keep going stop again and again therefore its a big issue. Google meet is better than this appü§¨üò†	0

Sara Bickel	2021-06-15	2	Up until 2 weeks ago, I LOVED this app. NOW, it is very annoying, since the mic cuts out constantly ü§® I know it's not my technology, because this only happens with zoom, nothing else. Zoom needs to fix this! Please!	14
M.S.THEVADHARSHINI VII A	2021-07-07	3	THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST APP, BUT SMALL SUGGESTION. IT IS BEING CONSIDERED FOR ONLY 40 MINUTES, SO PLEASE LET SOME MORE TIME THAN BEFORE. SOMETIMES IT IS NOT GOING INSIDE THE MEETING IT IS SHOWING CONNECTING FOR LONG TIME.	0
Jereferol Mcgrew	2021-05-09	3	I'm so so upset by this whole doctors going to zoom thing! It's sad that you can't look a doctor face to face but they can still look theirs face to your wallet and charge the same. Then understanding where to go from this app zoom being an email compared to some being a text is confusing. And, God forbid I be 75 and try to see a doctor through here and for the first time. It's never given directive its not simply understood by the entire public because it is the newest or finest thing out !	163
Pooja Chauhan	2021-04-23	3	I like zoom because sometimes My sound don't goes to teacher so, it has the option of a raise hand, so I can easily answer and we can also talk in personal number and we can easily use this app. So that's why I like it. Kids are also able to use this app easily. Presentation and video is so clear. Voice is also clear. I like this app very very very much. How to download new emojis?when I press the download button the emojis are not downloading. The rest of the app is good. Easy üòâüëçto use.	65
Barbie girl	2021-07-06	1	This app doesn't deserve even a single star .Google meet is better than zoom cloud metting.This app is totally useless app ,class get cut many times with this app , the quality of this app is very bad, sometimes I miss my important classes when I use this app	0
Ramya Sri B	2021-05-20	2	The reason for 2 stars on app is because: 1)When I try to join the meeting it has taking 5 to 10 min to get in to meetting 2) When I make a call during the meeting then audio gets off 3) When meeting has run through screen sharing then charging is reducing about 50% with in 15minutes 4 )Phone is getting heated quickly when meeting has run through screen sharing	72
Sidhartha Sankar Saha	2021-07-08	1	Application isn't working properly since 7th July .. today also the same problem continues please look into this matter	0

Linda Payton	2021-04-27	4	This app has been a lifesaver this past year! However, when I downloaded the app on my phone, it doesn't give me the option of joining a meeting just starting one which I am not trying to do. Too late now because the meeting was only 15minutes long, but I'd like to know what to do if I ever have to be away from my laptop again when I need to sign on.	23
Moni Mala Das	2021-06-05	2	It was good but it's becoming worse with updates 1) it uses a lot of charge 2) it uses a lot of net 3) it makes problem with some connections such as whenever I do maths class, I can see my video gets freezed, but others can see it, so I get out of the class but it still shows me that meeting in progress, and moreover after this freezing happens my phone gets switched off üò†üò†üò† pls correct this otherwise I won't be able to give my exams properly which is coming nearby...	1270
Fozia Faruqui	2021-06-15	4	I really love the app. But I think in this app you guys should add POLLS also I mean allow host to give polls and select the correct answer . Because this feature can make interest in children more to attend polls and come in leaderboard and this feature no other app has done because this is a unique idea üåà so I request to MAKE POLL FEATURE ACTIVEüéâ	5
Plutonium 239	2021-06-27	2	Zoom should improve live streaming part. Ability to display guest cams in many other ways. Better ways to branding. Capability to show users comment on stream video. Control fully guests mic and cam as a host. Also need multistreaming capability without going for third party tools to do that.	28
Josaephine Yukka	2021-04-24	5	Very helpful. My daughter has been attending online classes with less disturbamce since the last update. Too bad she can't change her background image because she's using a mobile phone. Hopefully the background change can be applied from all android phone, it would be superb.	98

27 Poulami Chakraborty VlllA1	2021-06-09	1	I know that all the students, teachers, business man all used this app to do the onpine activities but its a very bad app ever seen I gets disconnected thousand times and my teacher can't hear me properly means just nonsense but no way I have to do the classes with this app that's why I am using this app otherwise I don't have any attention to use this Very very very bad	11
Natasha Gimhani	2021-06-22	1	Zoom app is very clear app among online apps.Teachers and students can get high benefits from that.But,I have a little problem.But some times,some Errors come.That's the one and only matter to me.I like to give a new idea to zoom.If the zoom can get a screen full key board,I think it's good too.	9

SRIRAM B	2021-06-16	2	I would have given four stars but nowadays zoom drains my battery drastically and i even found loss of battery back up. If you want to check the data of how many apps has drained my battery then definitely zoom will be the first in that list ranking 8.2 percent according to Samsung's phone.	26
Chirag Maheta	2021-07-06	2	I'm student& I'm using this app from 2year I have face lots of trouble many times is disconnected automatically It has no sense about rotatetion If you minor moves your mobile to left or right than it rotete unwantedly it is major problem about this app It is too lazy and slow It's server is also bad some time we missed our important meetings It has many technical problem and itis repeat repeatedly I am very disappointed and tired from zoom This all are mine experience	0
Travelling Star	2021-06-14	5	It is a very useful and good online medium. There is no sound problem or video problem, unless u have run out with your data.I am very satisfied using it, although it consumes a lot of data so users with bad internet connections suffer a lot.	0

Trupti Ghate	2021-06-01	1	Zoom is very helpful aap in this pandemic doing a good job for students and their studies. But this aap quality is very poor that everytime there is connecting problem. Meeting doesn't even connect and if it gets disconnected after a second. So, if this problem get solved then this aap is going to be perfect.	2
Nagulapalli Sarvani	2021-06-05	4	Everything is good except my device does not support virtual background. I really love the app, I could have given 5 stars but I do not have one feature which all my classmates haveüò≥ but overall its great except for this one sad pieceüòâüëçüèªüòäNext time please allow all devices to support virtual background and one more thing is that if all the features of computer is there in an android device then it would be magnificent!	707
Korgi God	2021-06-21	1	I will get to the meeting but everything cuts in and out. Even though my wifi and everything is fine it will quit the meeting then restart it. On top of the your app downloaded things to my phone that I didn't want! What the hell is up with that!? You guys need to hop on top of this immediately.	6
Okurut A. Ebyau	2021-05-13	3	"...I wish the screen could be more interactive. Or is it a limitation of Android? Instead of going to the bottom of the screen for options like 'participants', why not have a tap on the screen and then a menu offers you more options to choose such as the 'participants."""	58
Ajeet Singh Thind	2021-05-26	3	This app is good, but there is a weak point in this app that meeting time is limited, after 40 mins, we have to start a new meeting. Please give users more time limit like google meet and jio meet, these apps don't even have a time limit, and that thing of these apps make them the best, so if you wanna make this app best, then exceed the time limit.............üòíüòí	9
Oluwayomi Ariyo	2021-06-08	4	Excellent app. I would highly recommend it to others! It gets harder to use after every update, though. It uses up more data and it tells you 'meeting in progress' even when you've been cut off. Please work on these so I can give you a 5-star rating in my next review.	60
Prity Agrawal	2021-06-18	1	The worst thing is the recording...***ing online classes are done with this software & it even doesn't allow recording to participants..all the teachers speak so fast & sometimes poor connection..wo could not get the notes..its so disappointing that it doenst allow us to record the meetings..also scren recordings when we try it doesn't give us audio..I m really frustrated üòì	11

Pranav Cholleti	2021-06-24	1	The new update of zoom made it worse. The previous versions were ok. The new update made zoom crash more, whenever i open participant list it restarts app. I think this update brought more crashes than updates. Fix this as soon as possible.	16

Not something any parent wants to explain!	25

Aryan hule	2021-06-09	5	We use Zoom for group calls, screen sharing, presentations, webinars. international calls, training and more. Zoom works great on any platform.

Moutali Chakraborty	2021-06-17	3	This app is pretty cool but the main cause that I've given 3 star üåü is that, its very complicated, u cannot record the meeting in mobile or tablet even if the host has given u the option. It creates a big problem for me.	7

Megan Reeder	2021-05-10	4	Zoom is great overall, but the fact that you can only view 4 people tiles per page during a meeting is very annoying. Though 4 per page makes sense on a smaller phone, more and more people are using tablets as computers these days. I hope there is a tablet option soon in the settings that will allow many more tile options per page.	382
Bassam Murthasa	2021-06-16	4	It is a wonderful, very useful and helpful app. But I am experiencing an issue with the microphone. If I receive a call while the meeting is going on, Others cannot hear me after I attended the call.	50

Kartikeya Korapala	2021-06-26	1	This app breaks the privacy of the participents, i don't know how can the app record the screen of the participent not only in zoom but records everything he does in the device without any permission or indecating the participent, every person has his own privacy in the device, it can be personal messages or even passwords. The zoom app has no rights to record the personal screen without any indication	14
Douglas Equality Spruner	2021-04-29	5	Zoom is very easy to use. It costs you nothing to use this app. I have 2 Dr. Appointments every month and I've never had any problems so far. I've been using zoom for almost 1 year and I recomend it as an option when you can't meet face to face. But you still need to speak privately to your doctor. Have a great day.	974
Sanjida Rahman	2021-06-04	5	This apps is very useful specifically for the students.In this pandemic situation,Student's can't go to institutions.But,by using this app,many Students can do class.I am also kinda student. Although I'm very benefited for zoom I've face a lot of problem basis network/report problem.I can't join my class most of the time.This make a great loss of my study.So,I request you,the authority who provide us such facility to access me all the facilities of this useful apps.	2

Abilash M	2021-05-25	1	I am being disconnected from the meeting, when I switch apps. Apparently, I should still be connected in the meeting when I lock the phone, browse different apps. But it keeps kicking me out when I do the above mentioned. This wasn't the case earlier.	20
Paul Strehlow	2021-04-24	4	My experience with the app I just use it for the first time and conference video conference deal most of it would be operator error I guess I should slow down best thing I can recommend people slow down when you're looking at your settings read them all the way through so that you do get it correctly set up other than that it seemed to work really fine I did have one point of fade but that was probably the Internet carrier I'm using and the wife I was getting in the way sometimes it's easier to	46

Darren Yu	2021-04-23	3	Missing a lot of key features that a lot of other conferencing applications have. One notable example, being able to locally mute other users.

Dazzling Snivy	2021-05-29	4	It is a good video chatting app, but needs one thing. Close Captioning, since sometimes audio may cut out during calls, so it will be easier to understand people talking with or without audio. Noneoftheless, it needs a little work, but is a decent app.	1

Hoping the problem gets solved to the earliest.....	56
Elva Harris	2021-06-03	5	I started to use zoom after the pandemic started last year mostly for church,but for whatever claw comes along.

Puskar Aggarwal	2021-05-05	1	This one of the worst cloud meeting platform , I have saw in my life . It gives all power to host , and give him/her control of our device. It acts like a malware. Top malware like behaviour of this app: 1) Not allowing to mute meeting while wearing earphone. 2) Pop on screen without user's permission on both while joining meeting and when opening your phone 3) Not allowing to turn off phone volume completely. And much more , I totally against of such kind of malicious apps.	52

Mark-Daniels Tamakloe	2021-05-12	5	So far so good but I suggest zoom should introduce an option to enable participants to record a meeting for future perusal. At least the host could be made to enable such an option for the participants to record the session for their future use. Thanks.	101
Tim Clarke	2021-05-27	5	LOVE IT! Using zoom on a mobile device is a super simple and smooth experience.

Angela Dunk	2021-06-06	4	Great for all kinds of meetings and events, small or large! Sound quality not always great though during some events. Price plans are a bit too expensive I feel as basic only gives you 40 minutes. Overall really good for gatherings of all kinds.	37

isabelle robinson	2021-05-20	3	Zoom is a great app to spend video calling friends or virtual lessons with kids.

Nathanael Williams	2021-06-01	3	Where would we be without Zoom! I use Zoom a lot, and it's the best video call/webinar service I've used. Zoom itself is fantastic on Windows and iOS/iPadOS, but the Android app is quite basic and not at the same standard as the apps for other OSs, it is lacking in features, is fiddely to use, and does not share the same design as the other Zoom apps. But I've never had any problems with the features that are here not working as expected.	69

GordonGrams	2021-05-27	4	Zoom has better sound and video than other platforms I've tried but it's far too expensive. I only need it once a month for a 2-hour book club meeting and the free version has a 40 minute time limit. ‚òπÔ∏è Why can't they offer occasional users an affordable option?	1

Can Ergun	2021-05-16	1	Ugh. Seems like I can't connect to a Bluetooth speaker and use phone mic on Android. Search results suggest this is some sort of 'privacy' feature as Zoom meetings are treated as calls, although not actually phone calls, and not media audio; I'm capable of managing the audio routing of my own devices though.	47

Ane gaming	2021-07-06	1	Waiting for the host is the issue i am facing and while the meeting is happening. I try re joining but it's the same.	0

Ele Illah	2021-06-28	4	Zoom is a very good app to use. Can I suggest that when meeting links are sent in advance, we should be able to click the link and have the option to save in our calendars as the meeting is yet to start.	12
Pooja Gupta	2021-06-14	4	The new feature of 40 mins meeting I just hate it the meeting of 2 hr finishes in 40 min and then we have to again and again start it that's the worst part and is also a of me giving 4 stars. Otherwise this app is so convenient to use. Thank you!	8
Danthuri Adithya	2021-06-25	5	Of course i was giving 5 star to this app But we want some new features like not only host the participants also should record metting with audio There is no other app to record audio in this app U can try with new recording app or otherwise pls give option to participants Nowadays online mode of education is going on in this app so,if u provide recording to participants then students can record their classes...

Smile ;D	2021-05-12	1	Can't make another zoom account with a single email and its very annoying since all family members need different IDs but the kids don't have their personal email accounts. I had to make seperate email accounts just for this. Requires too much hassle in logging in and making accounts. Switching between accounts is also impossible	44
OJASVI Sheokand	2021-07-07	4	It is good but it is is very disappointing that we can't join meeting there is connecting but it not join you should improve this overall it is a good app...	0
Iraqui's Technical point	2021-04-30	4	Very nice app.I use it since many time but it take so much data for 1 meeting of 40 minutes it's take some 200 to 250 mb of our daily data while the Google meet take for 1 hour meeting only some 20 to 40 mb of daily data.So,give the update of using less data.If you give the less data update so,I give you 5 stars.plese solve our issues.	152

Harmanjot Singh	2021-04-23	1	This app doesn't work properly. I can't even sign up. Whenever i try to sign up it shows the birth date window and it doesn't go ahead of it. It shows that I'm not eligible to sign up. I have tried many times. Even on other devices it shows the same pop up window. Please fix it so i can sign up. Thanks.	125
Rahees Mir	2021-06-24	4	The app gives better experience after every update. But if the option for set the video quality will add, it will be the best user friendly app. I hope the developer of this app soon do this work. Thanks	3
Sankarsh Vemulapati	2021-05-31	4	Have been using Zoom from a year, got a problem now,when I connect my Bluetooth headphones it is disconnecting and turning off speaker mode. Got irritated with that.Apart from that everything is good. Edit: I now realised that it isnt ur problem its because of my bluetooth network as u said this is hd video great and also zoom is helping me for my video conferences and in ur new update i dont understand how to pin people earlier i pressed participants and pin option but now search anddoubleclick	74
Avnish Verma	2021-06-02	1	I didn't like this app any more! This app sucks! Whenever a call comes during the zoom meeting I have to sign up again and again and sometimes it wouldn't work but it's my problem to install it again because I have to attend my school meeting!!!!	74
Sheikh Mohammad Mohi Uddin	2021-07-02	5	Excellent application, Thanks all developer who given their best. Love from my heart and best wishes. Most useful application for teachers and students in this COVID 19 situation. Many many thanks once again.	1
Preeti Deepak	2021-07-09	1	When I use this zoom app first time ,it works fastly and after some months it doesn't do work good and zoom has many error which thry should do correct that things , because it occurs many problem because of which I am unable to do connect my meeting	0

Yashodhan Khopkar	2021-05-21	5	No other app is as good as zoom that's for sure. Good audio and video quality. Happy with this app. User friendly and can connect with students quickly and easily. In this lockdown period this app must have helped many teachers like me and many more from other fields too.	24
james wong	2021-06-30	5	Excellent. Really enjoy zooming, very clear audio and video	0
Ishara Liyanage	2021-07-03	5	Good app for meeting. I am studying at home by using this app. HD quality available. The only problem is after 40 minutes the meeting end.	0
vibha singh	2021-07-01	4	This is best app for meetings, it has all the features that should be in a meeting app. Emojis, Chat, screen sharing, Video background. But please make option like a team, Because some participants send the link in the facebook,and unknown people join in meeting and make us disturb.	6
Greg Van Hyfte	2021-04-28	2	Please give the option to hide self view in all modes including speaker mode. Have you seen the research that seeing yourself on a video call over and over again contributes to Zoom fatigue? This new update that forces users to see ourselves at all times is a detriment to the usability of this app. Please add this option ASAP. THANK YOU	27
Dhruv Yadav	2021-06-17	1	A month ago I gave it 5 stars but now it is not working. Every time I try join to any meeting it shows can't connect to our services. Even my Network connection is pretty good. Google meet works fine and Zoom does not.	7
Jairo Vanegas	2021-06-24	3	Acceptable. Far more usable than the desktop app, perhaps not surprisingly. Infuriatingly strong battery drain. I can barely make it through a 3 hour meeting on a chromebook that comfortably gives me 10-12 hours of medium to heavy use.	9
yeosang's hehetmon	2021-06-15	3	great but it will be amazing if this zoom app was similar to the one on pc (the view of the cameras - not only 4 in a slade - standar/ gallery view, the chat in a side, and the background	5
mala rajesh	2021-06-24	5	üëâThis app is very useful to attend online class for school and college students and easy to join meeting so zoom is a best then other apps so I giving 5 stars and one more thing it can able to meet 100 to 300 members at a time in this app every one are listioning online classes during covid time in zoom app only. Thank you!	20
MAYANK JAIN	2021-07-09	1	Worst app ******* . It was working fine earlier but after the last update it is not working wellüëπüëπ	0
Daksh Singh	2021-07-02	1	I am experiencing blank black screen continuously with good internet connection So bad app Google meet is 100 times better than this	30
Shernan Neil Tubig	2021-06-02	3	I liked this app and I've been using this for more than a year but the recent update gives me a headache. I can't see in my screen those who are raising. I need to click the participants to be able to see who are raising their hand, this is quite a hassle for me coz I'm just using my mobile phone.	111
FB06 Rutuja Tapkir	2021-07-09	1	Not working good from last few days that's why I was get disappointed to my lecture and that's why there is issue in my study and marks too ü§∑üòë now really I don't like zoom	0
A Faber	2021-05-28	4	Great app, but my Samsung Galaxy Tab A slows down sometimes unexpectedly. Zoom makes a valient effort to minimize the disruption, but it would be nice to be able to know what is competing for processor attention.	1
Jhumki Datta	2021-06-25	1	I have a problem that when i am in a meeting sometimes i got disconnected but my network is very good and the zoom app is also updated but why is this happening please fix this issue as soon as possible otherwise i cannot do a meeting properly	3
Jayanthi Haridas	2021-06-10	5	Very Useful to all in this Lock Down....We Can See Our Family Who are far away has though we visited them. Usefull in many ways. Thanks team zoom! Unable to connect to Bluetooth when screencast is done, please check on this! Thanks.	37
Malem longjam	2021-06-21	5	This app. Is so useful I like this app. Btw this app. Give to all students to meet and talking to each other's for exam note or something good. At least this app. Review to 5 star rate I like that from my site.	5
Sujata Parbat	2021-06-03	4	It is very good to me and I feel reliable while using it for its features . It is also very good as host in sense that the host can mute , share screen to the participants . And the video quality is good . But the main disadvantage is that it consumes a large amount of internet .	50
Aloysius	2021-04-21	1	The Fingerprint ID on Andriod does not even work. I tried to enable quite a number of times but it just logged me out and when I log back in, the feature is not even enabled at all. Please fix this immediately as soon as possible.	743
Siddhi Agrawal	2021-06-08	1	Most critical app I have seen yet. Everytime I put in the link and click on join meeting it directly exits and for it to join a class I need to always uninstall and install the app to join only a class. And I have 10 classes everyday. I will suggest everyone here who are reading my review to actually move to other apps instead of zoom.	79
Kirstie Edwards	2021-05-12	4	It's great on the whole but still glitchy. The sound isn't very loud, I have to use headphones to hear properly. Some users can have a background but for some reason I do not have this option nor am I able to save the chat. Other than that it has been a great support with online lessons during these last 14 months.	27
Naman J. vora	2021-06-19	4	Like some experience is not so good:as I'm a bluetooth headphones user so when i was in the meeting if i use to open any other app and then see an video the zoom disconnect the Bluetooth audio and then i have to rejoin in the meeting......	2
Adrian G.	2021-04-23	5	A very good app! I have just a suggestion: would be nice if instead of 4 frames on the android phone and tablet to see more people on one page, like 6 or 9 people :) to not slide pages to see the 5th or 6th person. I hope it makes sense to what I say. Thank you	69
Aliahmad khan	2021-06-28	5	It is the best app for meeting but some sound are not come to me. and when host share screen and it's not coming den we press down dots of partisipent then the sharing screen not download. But zoom is the best meeting app üôÇüôÇüôÇ.	2
Meryll Mino	2021-07-05	2	I need to change my background video but there is no option for virtual background in my setting. Though I already enable it in my account settings through web. I'm so upset!	0
Jaifreefire Alok	2021-07-09	5	Op Adding to abhinav is the most important of all of a level results and time for all to see it in a new world class and the latest test in chola will have to the most	0
Sumaira Mahboob	2021-06-21	5	This app is great! I downloaded it on my Tab A! It works perfectly, Screen sharing and most are the experience I have! Same as meet but meet does not have a raise hand tool in the tablets! Zoom has! It is the best and try it out	30
Gurzen ansari	2021-07-01	5	Best app for meeting and classes, but pls add the features of virtual background in android which supports virtual background in processors like exynoss 9611,snapdragon 665 etc.	0
Late Gamers	2021-07-05	1	Worst! App I have ever seen, when my teacher is used to in me in the room then it throws me in another where there is no host but I am only present there.	0
Komal Agrawal	2021-05-31	4	This app is really nice but the thing I don't like is that when you are in a meeting with more than 4 people you cannot see all of the people on one screen you have to keep on swiping until you see the person you want to see so I would like you to make a Gallery view this is available on Google meet but not on zoom so please you that I give it a 5 Star if you do but overall I love this app it is really nice app to connect with your friends and family on a birthday or like any occasion.	74
Miss Nufur	2021-07-01	4	It is a best app for online class or meeting but there is a problem that is we can only meet 100 people but in our class there is more Than 100 people. So I want to change the no.of people. It will be good for everyone. üòá	0
Hitlar G	2021-07-06	1	Why can't we record lectures with audio, when we record session audio is not recorded.	0
Nipun Wani	2021-05-06	1	Its not good infact it doesn't give ant privacy to participates all the powers are given to only host Yes, some of the features are necessary to host but it is very critical to participates No, privacy , whenever the host want to remove it will remove without asking you a permission feature must be added to zoom other features are ok . Really pooorrrr	17
sean nathan	2021-06-17	1	I wish there was a way to turn off group chat. I only want to hear the speaker without being distracted by audience commentary. Not a fan of the many steps required to hook up with a regular daily zoom.	10
Paul Thayyil	2021-06-17	1	Very difficult to join a meeting as it tells connecting... Even though I have a good internet connection of 4g. The old version didn't have any problem. Now it's very difficult and I cannot attend any of my meetings	214
Sunnysidedown	2021-06-26	5	Zoom is a very good app but in the middle of my online dance lesson it kept kicking me and taking me back in and i was so confused why and at the end of my class it ASKED ME TO RATE IT IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS i'm really mad but other than that its a good app you can text,call,chat and make groups I recomend to download this!	4
Ariel Sanchez	2021-05-06	1	We pay for Zoom meeting licenses, not Zoom Phone licenses. We have an issue where Zoom started making itself the default dialer inside Work profiles- not even offering the option. It started maybe two weeks ago, from looking at Android release notes, v5.6.3. there's no way I have found to remove zoom ohone functionality.	28
Jk6782 56	2021-05-10	1	It want so much changes it has no idea to work and no clear and original sound. I don't like this app. It needs to so much good changes and also do change in it sound. It dosen't show the icon change pic. In a week it want to update two three times. I doesn't like this app	24

Santu Das	2021-05-19	1	Something very annoying, not sure if this is an issue with zoom. I am using Samsung phone.

I started getting ""Draining Battery"" warnings, and now i opened the background restrictions to max level. On meetings it's draining battery more. This is not the only problem, but i don't want to make a novel of it..."	24
Ayushi Pawar	2021-07-09	4	Nice App I would have given 5 but i gave 4 cuz if the virtual background was available for mobile phomes also that would be best! Please do the needful.	0
Annisa Junaidi	2021-05-31	3	good, but please give options for tablet users to have background chat too. it's been too long for me to wait for zoom to have the same features for the laptop and tablet.

Jodi	2021-05-18	1	This is crazy. Can't unmute and can't speak during meetings. The button for auto mute is off so why does this keep happening? Also Can't text during meetings which would have helped because was muted the entire meeting. Don't bother with this app as it doesn't work.	20
Husna Banu	2021-06-19	4	Zoom is a very good app for your meetings you can chat with people in meetings and chat with host . You can even host a meeting scheduled. Well, ZOOM is a good app	0
Katherine Brown	2021-05-06	3	I like using Zoom. I would add two stars if you created a way I could test & practice with Zoom settings & connecting. I've used Zoom for medical appointments during COVID-19, but I can't take up their time learning how to do these things. I'd like to add a background when I'm using Zoom on my phone & on my PC.	26

Lye Heng Foo	2021-05-22	4	Excellent tool to conduct classes. But inconsistencies within android app Vs windows app Vs Linux app cold be painful at times. Some functions like annotation tool or multiple spotlight tool only works in one platform but not another. Due to this, those using platform that is different from host platform may experience weird app behaviour. Wish better QA and better convergence of the tools features within different platforms	26
Archna Patil	2021-07-07	1	Wast of time for downloading the app was Not starting when i install it was saying error error so please solve my problem	0

Me	2021-05-08	1	This app sucks, it automatically closes after i join, I'm unable to attend my classes. I've always had problems with this app since the beginning. I wonder what kind of algorithm they used in their code that have the app close right after joining for some reason... Their programmers might be really dumb and amateurs.	31
Madhuri Ramya	2021-05-08	1	Zoom brings me out of my meeting automatically to my desktop and keeps loading for some time and then it goes back joins the meeting without my interference. But by the time again I get added board is completely filled up and I miss the concepts.Zoom doesn't support bluetooth connection tooü•∫üò´üò£. It's completely disgusting ü§¨ Hope you improve your app in a better wayüôÇ	50
Kashyap Sisters	2021-05-11	5	This makes our work more easier and makes the world more smaller. We are more comfortable with it and we doesn't get tired üòÖ if we compare with our earlier conversation in Cafe or classes in school makes us very exhausted üò¥. If we have connectivity problem than it's not zoom's problem I am happy üòä with it you must try it for a once üòâüòä	31
Gloria Vivek	2021-06-13	4	The App is really useful, but our video shows the rear video. It will be good if the video is shown to others the way we see ourselves through our phone. Thank you!	5
Tanmay Bhandare	2021-04-29	3	Zoom is a good app for meetings, But some time I can't join to mettings because there is network problem.

Thank you	94
Chetali Kaler	2021-06-11	3	The app is good and easy to use but I have been trying to sign in or sign up for 3 months but every time I try It shows that you are not eligible to sign in( or sign up)at this moment. And because of that I am not able to access all the features of the app. This is why I am giving 3 stars. Please fix this.	114
Kaaman Sharma	2021-05-27	3	Too good at the time of covid and the company has vary vast opportunity to build a large network but now they are loosing it due to the bug which are here and the media which turned out to be really against in using this as a platform foe virtual communication .....sorry .. zoom wake up unless Google will take you down soon Work on media too company is important services can be improved but image can't ..	786
genesis formiloza	2021-06-15	1	This is a summary of a rushed app that was developed for academics because they want to make an app that is suited for industry but it already has a flaw., I already have trouble signing in to my school email (app_not_configured_for_user) even if tried signing to my SAML its still the same, it takes you to a browser then shows you this error then thats it, no details what so ever on what to do or how to fix this. Its so frustrating, because ive been trying to fix this for more than an hour.	8
43_Srishti Jain	2021-07-01	1	Nice but due to this app mobile hangs too much and during studies whenever I switch on my mic I can't hear teacher's voice and it creatas difficulty when we are asked to swich on mic So developers please try to fix it.	3
Anvesh More	2021-05-18	2	This new update (5.6.4.1852) doesn't work well with my bluetooth headphones. Trying to connect with another phone (it has older version installed) it works like a charm. Today I tried using my headphones on aux (wired) mode it worked. Please fix this issue.	13

Mohammad Kaif	2021-06-21	3	Lags sometimes ...uses a lot of your data ..while the audio and video quality are just awesome..the chat system and the raising hand options are well. ..	0
Valente Espinosa	2021-05-19	4	It's good, but the UI is a little choppy and scrolling through the gallery view also feels off, also a few parts of the interface look like stretched out versions of the phone interface, it could be smoother and better optimized for Android Tablets like the iPad app.	7
Yashovardhan Dhanania	2021-05-04	1	There are serious issues with webinars on zoom. Minimising the app pauses audio. Even opening chats/QA pauses audio. So I need to stay on the webinar screen for the entire time or I can't hear anything. Also the video shouldn't rotate automatically if autorotate is turned off in the phone settings.	34
Rishi Chanardip	2021-06-01	5	"I absolutely love it, it works wonderfully but it takes long to update, the emoji library takes forever to download and it is very hard to get a profile picture. If zoom was to update again, I suggest to have a ""set profile picture"" option in settings ."	79
Tanu Raj	2021-06-21	2	Worst app.... I installed it and it not sign up with my any email....it shows only that u r no eligible to sign into zoom this time ......while I'm trying since two days.. this app should no right to get any stars...üòíüòíüò°üò°üò†....	3
Jim Paton	2021-06-30	4	Tried to use my S21 Ultra's rear camera on a zoom session. I wanted to use a high zoom level but the app wouldn't let me zoom in very far. Maybe it is only working with one of the rear cameras?	0
Creative Bharat	2021-07-07	1	Very bad app. Anytime the server goes down and only 40 minutes limit!! For meetings. I rate 1 star to this app. Google Meet is better than this app.	0
Holly Miller	2021-06-06	3	I love the idea behind this platform, but the number of times it cuts off, how finicky it is, and the fact that there's no two way synchrony is absurd. I mean, really... even the old telephone had two way synchrony.	36
jvos	2021-07-06	1	I want old version of zoom cloud im missing it. New version consumes more internet like 1gb but old one takes 300 mb for all my classes in a day.	0

Minister May	2021-05-31	4	My second time of using it on this device, it really disappointed me big time on a very important meetings appointment but am sure there was an error somewhere, that I know it was unusual so hopefully they (developers)will help me sort it out.	42
Hiya	2021-06-25	3	Earlier when I used to switch on my video and close the zoom app on phone, the video froze. But now when I close the app with my video switched on, it automatically switches off. üòí The earlier feature was better where the video used to freeze instead of switching off.	3
Keosha Mishra	2021-06-23	2	Zoom doesn't detect microphone. For last 2 weeks, I am not able to do my classes. I can attend the classes but teaches are not able to listen me. I have checked all possible settings	2

GG Larocque	2021-07-07	4	It gets a bit glitchy once in a while, but pretty good otherwise.	0
Dorri Me	2021-06-17	3	Overall it's amazing, but I need to SIGN IN/UP (there's no option to LOGIN) the app every single time I open & that's very annoying. I really wanted to know why does the App LOG OUT itself?	6
Sinu Biju	2021-06-24	2	I can't sign up in this app. They are telling that, I'm not eligible for this app. But my 10 years old sister can sign up. WHY? I'm 15 years old .my friends and all are signed up WHY NOT ME. After these all its a good app. Good audio and video clarity.	1
Lokendra Chauhan	2021-06-25	4	It's a good app, very user friendly. Net speeds in location of use is the only limitation. No wonder it is the most used app in it's category.	0
Janice Cole	2021-04-28	5	A great way to connect with a group of people, family, friends, etc. when the least amount of human connection was required of us. Zoom continues to be an avenue of connection now, even as we are beginning to see a return to what we consider normal living. Kudos!	16
Nat M	2021-06-03	1	Very easy to use and lots of options, but no automatic captioning, making it totally inaccessible to me! Oh and support email address has an automated response message stating they cannot respond to any free account user queries! Very poor customer service.	86

Surbhi Sharma	2021-06-21	5	This is great . I have ever seen we have so many options right here to choose like share screen and so many things we have .. and also we can meet so many people together..woow its amazing to meet together rather than meet people separately.. features are also good and i love it	11
L FA	2021-05-18	1	It is not a safe app. I was having a meeting,and all of a sudden I found someone in the meeting sending strange messages to the meeting chat insulting with vulgar words and I did not give the meeting link except to those I know and they didn't give the link to anyone else. I can't believe that something like this can happen in Zoom. NOT SECURE	31

Sowrya Shanthibhushan reddy Kanjula	2021-06-12	2	Using more data & wi-fi by this app. No improvement in settings. It's better to have settings like ,manage the video & audio quality settings to prevent data loss.	3
Joyce Smith	2021-07-01	2	The duration on Zoom should be extended... It's actually Faustrating when the application closes a meeting when it's up to 45min... Pls the during should be as to when you want to close the meeting yourself...	4

Huba Sultani	2021-05-28	3	Please implement two speaker volume levels, by reading the proximity sensor for private audio only meetings. Very convinient to use on a mobile device when on the move or not near a personal computer! Your experience may vary.	2

Ali Arab	2021-06-24	4	This app is really good , an outstanding app indeed but there is no way you could typ on the whiteboard and I think its really needed. If you provide this option then Zoom will be the best app for Meetings.	3

Ramesh Sharma	2021-06-05	1	This app's quality is very poor..... I used it for my online classes, I had 7 classes a day.....

When I login with the right passcode it shows wrong passcode..... I have many problems with this app...... I am just frustrated with this app......... I suggest everyone not to install this app.....	48

Peggy Perez	2021-05-28	5	This was a court hearing and everything went smooth once you were able to figure out that you have to push all the buttons before you get into the meeting because if you don't you can't go back and do it you got to sign out and then sign back in that's a little hard you guys should have an option to be able to get in there just in case somebody forgets to turn on their audio or their video	502
Madhvi Gupta	2021-06-27	1	Worst app that is in my life. Audio and video in bad, when I lost connection it remove me from meeting. Captions are üíØ persent wrong. I hope if you see my comment you're not going to install it	1

Anurag Kale	2021-05-12	2	Worst app for video calling.At first,i thought chat box is a great feature to send messages.Later,i came to know that whenever someone sends us message,our response can be sent to the messenger without selecting individually.But,this feature doesn't works sometimes & the message we want to send to the individual gets send to everyone which gets EXTREMELY AWKWARD & EMBARRASSING.I hate this as I am an student.Also,video quality is extremely bad regardless of the fact that you have a good networküëé	61
Priyanka Pahwa	2021-05-31	5	It is awesomeüòäüëçüëè.

April Merjil	2021-04-23	5	Love that my kids were able to use Zoom every day for school. And it's extremely helpful to use for doctor appointments and talking with family and friends out of state. It's helped tremendously since the pandemic. ‚ô°	115
Dinda SEASTRON	2021-05-08	5	This app is Really great!!! As Jehovah's witnesses we have been able to have meetings together as usual but also we have been able to enjoy association together, so this has been used as a great way to cope over lock down! Thank you!	37

Regina Mtokoma	2021-06-14	5	Have had nice experiences using zoom especially when you have good internet connectivity. You can a meeting anywhere as long as you are connected to internet and it is ideal in the situation with Covid 19	10
Pat Young	2021-07-06	5	Thank you for making this outstanding service available.

Abdullah Jan	2021-05-18	4	I like this I can use this for classes but there is 1 problem why I did 4 star because it does not have video filters and backgrounds on my iPad and no profile picture? But I have 45 backgrounds on my laptop but my laptops mouse is broken but I still like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	14
Zoro .41	2021-05-17	3	I started using it when i was a young boy i was forced to join online classes everyday and seeing this app now brings alot of memories some good and some bad but i can say one thing about this app please fix the problem That when you connect a bluetooth headphone you can only hear the meeting sounds in it and not both of the meeting and youtube please fix this problem i cant hear my youtube videos while taking classes its already hell taking them but without youtube thats just too much please.	31
836 Naushad Siddiqui	2021-05-07	4	Just disturbed by the floating speaker window Which blocks the screens side Due to which i cant see notes what teacher is giving. And app should ask before we do camera and mic on. Some time by mistake camera gets on and i am fla8nting all the things around me. Otherwise app is awesome and has good user interface.	10

Varsha Dixit	2021-06-21	4	Very nice app. I really enjoyed it. But it's not allowed to do meeting above 30 min for me bcz of the VIP. It's costly. Pls improve	1
Ratu Rehnuma Progga	2021-05-30	3	Giving 3/5. Coz, From mobile, can't start recoding, don't get many options in the mobile version. Most annoying matter is, the meeting time is only 40 mins! You should update zoom with meeting time atleast 2 hrs. You should fix all bugs & should improve the network capabilities.	106
Trevor Boston	2021-05-26	5	No real issues with zoom. This is a suggestion to the developers to consider adding a feature to estimate how much net GHG emissions reduction is associated with Zoom meetings compared with if everyone had to fly or drive to meet the meeting host in person.	1
Pragya Bhatta	2021-05-14	1	I had the worst experience with zoom. Before the app was working properly but from today I can't hear anything.I uninstalled the app and re-installed it but still the problem is there.I'm a student and this is harming my studies a lot..Even I'm unable to do my online classes..I would like to request the app authority to fix this problem..	32
Jha rameshwari	2021-06-17	3	Amazing app I have ever seen But one problem is there that it consumed the net very much. I'm giving the advise that you should download this app if your phone is having 3gb data per day.	0

SELVARAJU K	2021-06-22	3	Please update the latest version of zoom app at zoom's official website also. Some of our mobile phones not compatible with zoom app available in the google play store. So we are trying to download apk file from zoom's official website and then install it.	3
Allana Erispe	2021-05-28	5	This is a good app for meetings but the only problem is that the virtual background doesn't support all devices. I suggests that the developer/s of this app should improve the virtual background by supporting all version of the devices because not all of the people can afford to buy high end devices.	791
Prasad Sunkari	2021-07-08	1	"First it used to work good and well.... But now smgt happened and it shows connecting... And after some time it says ""unstable network "" then it shows error... I can't attend my online classes becoz of this problem"	0

AestheticCherries	2021-05-13	4	I love this when it comes to doing school time. I'm in Online Learning and I use this most of the time. But thing is, this needs to work on laggyness and visual. my teacher has times where sharing screen can be laggy, and sometimes she is paused and still able to talk.	6
Jatin Suhag	2021-07-06	5	this app is a mindblowing app.As i have used it for my online classes of school you can download this app for personal videocall or and bussiness meeting etc.i suggest that you should definetly install this.	0

Akshit Manglani	2021-06-24	1	You guys made a great app but why are you guys always giving useless and meaningless updates when they don't really matter but no we want to give an update for no reason your last to last update made audio lag issues which were not there before update and now with this update we have video issues where in mobile phones you can't see others video because it got stuck at one place means why do you even want to update every time it say update to solve bug issues but every time it introduces new one	7
Textile Gamer	2021-05-25	5	I can't use this application for so many time but I can see one thing in this app video Quality and Audio Quality are nice, but for some reason . I give 4 star rating, because this application have so much internet connection problem .	2

Lyricade	2021-05-01	5	This app is great and everything, but there is one question I have. Can you make it possible for us to know when someone reads our messages. I am talking about the in call chat, I'm talking about the meet and chat. Thus would be great, but overall this app is worth 5 stars.	49
Matheesha Rathnayake	2021-06-10	3	This is a very useful app but i'm a student.I have lots of clases from this app.This is better than other apps we can use to meet .i gave 3 stars But i can give 5... The problem is in this version we cant use virtual background.in mobiles we cant use it.	72

Sobeit M	2021-04-30	3	Very frustrating that there is no option to turn off subtitles if signed in on a samsung phone. The transcript obscures the view of the other participants screens, rendering some meetings pointless. This needs to be addressed.	44
Ashwani Singh	2021-05-22	1	The New update in this is very annoying because If you go to home screen for any work then suddenly it will kick you out of meeting and If I play a video in split screen the voice of the meeting and video both can't be heard. please change this update.	3
Rachael G	2021-06-25	4	Occasionally I have issues with the internet where it boots me out, brings me back in group and messes with sound and video. But mostly, this app is enjoyable and useful.	1

hscorp bd	2021-06-13	2	This is very hard to use. Sometimes it says the host removed you but why will the host remove me for no reason. Sometimes if I join the meeting it says waiting for the host to start the meeting.Please fix this bugs.	23
Bisakha Pattanaik	2021-06-19	3	It's a good app but it's people capacity no more than 100 so i don't like this app. Please as soon as possible change people system to join more than 100 people. Thank you.....	1

Swati Devassy	2021-04-30	5	This is an AMAZING app. Recently I hosted a meeting (in my house) and it worked soo good! If anything I would say when you join a breakout room to go a bit faster. That's all. I really like this app!üëç	58
Gretchen Ely Nordham, M.A.	2021-05-23	5	Used it alot for teaching yoga during lock down, i upgraded to professional subscription so it would not cut out halfway through class, now will probably downgrade. Was a bit clunky getting set up. Then, worked great. Easy to send invitations. If you ever show me an ad, I will quit immediately.	3
Masoud Aleali	2021-05-27	1	I missed three times meetings on this app. Either audio or video issues. When back to setting everything looks OK but not working during the meeting need to end it and reschedule!. In the future, I try to ask for using other apps for a virtual meeting.	2
Kan Murphy	2021-05-03	1	Last update makes now limits my ability to see. Used to see presenter as small in screen picture as well as screen shared by presenter. Now only screen shared picture. I only have a phone, no computer. Present has to turn off screen share when doing demos. A real negative on this update.	53
Mo han	2021-06-11	2	I am really disappointed to discover the virtual background option is only available on a limited number of android phones. It can't be that difficult to make this option available to more devices. Tech guys sort it out!	8
Erin Sardich	2021-05-03	3	I think a recent update to the Android version must have changed the ability for users to see the speaker during a webinar. There is no option to change views so that you can see the speaker like there used to be. Please put this back.	14
Kunal Singh RAJPUT	2021-06-11	3	This App is great but I am not giving it 5 Star Because Audio and Video quality is Low That's why I'm giving it 4 Stars If zoom will solve my problem then I would give it a 5 star	0
Ramesh Lingala	2021-07-09	5	Best quality in video interaction and in conducting meetings flawlessly...	0
SOHAG	2021-06-10	3	I have only one complaint that once we get disconnected it shows invalid meeting Id when we try to rejoin. That means once disconnected, we have big problem in rejoining. Rest is ok.	3
Leigh Cubar	2021-04-25	5	I would suggest you would also a setting where you can request a participant to connect their audio (not request to unmute). It would be helpful as a host for others who we can't reach to help with their app and can't instruct them what to do when a meeting is ongoing	49
Costas Kletsides	2021-06-06	1	It's been a while since I had so much trouble creating an account and manging to start a video call through an app or service. Whoever is responsible for the way this app is structured should be ashamed of himself. Buttons greyed out, can't do anything. No prompt to help the situation, no hint. No settings to change. Why am I not able to start a meeting?!	26
Preeti Jalnapurkar	2021-06-17	5	It is so nice app but the problem is that their is virtual background added but it is in some phones only so please add it in every phone.best app for communication and virtual class.	0

Laarni May Taclay-Cruz	2021-06-13	5	Best for bible study and for corporate meetings to karaoke session... I hope this can be lowered in cost and every Filipino family can benefit. Zoom is the best. I hope also they can improve the sharing. It has a delayed audio and slowed video. Thank u	35
Narayan Sharma	2021-07-03	2	Really worst it get automatically leave , I can't able to join a single meeting after the update..	0
SHASHANK PULLURI	2021-05-18	1	I'm using this almost for an year. After recent update they increased the size of our video and also made it to float. Due to size increase it covers some part of my class. In previous version it is just fine. I don't know why increased the size. I request you to make it as it is in the previous version.	8
Sarah Price Hancock	2021-05-17	3	I'm grateful for Zoom. For some reason, when I use the app, it will not allow the audio to connect with Bluetooth speakers. Other audio from other apps connect without issue, but Zoom will not play through paired Bluetooth Bose speakers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	4
DEBMALYA SWAIN	2021-07-05	1	Very bad galua,sudhu nirlajya(100% truly ultra sameless)app.Very much bad words saided by me is very less to this idotic defective app.Showing password invalid many very times when I is going in tution.This zoom is 100% like 'muncipality daba'(garbage).Wasting my pleasant nirmala timeüò°üò°üò°üò°.	1

Anu Anu	2021-06-11	3	Good Application For Video Conference. However , I rate it only three star . Because even high end tablet like Samsung Tab S7 has only Four participant view in gallery mode . Please Make it Nine or Sixteen participant view in gallery mode .	60
Yuvraj Singh	2021-06-05	1	So many connections eror every day, after reporting no improvement , Google meet is better , This app is using because it has a option that no one can unmute himself or herself without asking host .

Horses As Is	2021-04-29	4	Overall, I love it. However, the fact that I don't have full control of th eapp on my Amsung Tab-s4 is annoying. I don't have a good greenscreen option, and have no freedom do upload any other virtual backgrounds outside of the three that are provided.	37
Varsha Vijaykumar	2021-06-04	2	Actually nice...but a main drawback is we cannot keep the camera on if we go to some other apps...that's annoying...and for mobile users...u wont have that much facilites...but for pc and laptops..u will enjoy.	0
Abhinav kandukuri	2021-06-15	4	Zoom is very good but the update of google meet that background of the camera can be selected by us and make us only visible. If it is also there it will be the best.	3

Heidi Corey	2021-06-05	1	Works when it wants but otherwise missed a meeting due to kept circling around and wouldn't connect when on my end it's fine. Meeting host even gave me 3 toll-free numbers to call in to just listen and none of them worked! Zoom is not dependable when you need it.	34
Lesley Burt	2021-05-25	1	Found it difficult to use. I've had to have a lot of help from friends and family. could be an awful lot easier to use .and then to Discover that once we use it a couple of times. it cuts out unless you subscribe was really bad news.	5
Amal Baby	2021-06-30	3	Please change the automatic rotating screen. That is very difficult. If we on the auto rotate option then no problem other wise change it to portrait position	0

Jason R	2021-05-23	3	The app is really nice, but I wish when you Miracast to tv for a large meetings you can hear the sound through the tv instead of having to hook up a Bluetooth speaker. The zoom app only uses it the mobile speaker only. Other than that the app is ok.	4
DJ CAZ03	2021-05-24	5	I love this app but the only issue is if u don't have premium u are only limited to a certain amount of time which is a pain because I do a few events on the app and I can only do 40minutes of time which isn't enough. But I will have to deal with it for a while since I can't afford to get premium	1
Danique Williams	2021-06-10	4	It is a great platform for meetings and other interactions that cant be done face to face. Though at times during my meetings it freezes and i dont appreciate that at all.	9
Spandan Patnaik	2021-06-10	3	Please add a landscape mode. The screen rotates by itself. And it's very annoying. It is causing problems in my online classes.	3

Arifunnisa Baig	2021-04-23	4	This app is good, but I have only one problem that, I want to record the classes to listen it again, but this option is not there in phone. Also we can record only with host permission in pc. This is my only one problem. So please fix it as fast as possible	29
Anusha Pichuka	2021-05-15	2	Generally I use the zoom app in my computer but when it doesn't support I use to go through it from my mobile but when ever I use it in my mobile it would word it just stops at report problem. And a code . Till now 1 had installed like 20 times but it's not working...	7
Kanishka Verma	2021-04-26	2	It is such a good and useful app but I was having a big issue when I open the link it shows 'preparing meeting' which is very annoying and when I share a video on zoom the video will not be audible to the participants although it's a very helpful app.. ‚ò∫	22
stephen campbell	2021-05-09	4	Very good. Easy to use. Great way to keep communication with family , friends , and my congregation. Only issue for me is that conversation not as easy as in real life as it can't be as spontaneous unless it's just 1 to 1or a few. But it's still a boon in these restricted times.	27
Alanna Dumas	2021-06-09	4	I use Zoom on a nearly daily basis. I often get kicked out or have it freeze on my computer, likely due to the status of my computer. However, having it on my phone has been a lifesaver for classes.	7
Raipie	2021-06-02	4	Can you please put a Face Filter Option in Zoom?. Beacuse the face looks very bad in the camera. But in reality the face isn't that bad. I guess many wants a filter app as no one wants to look bad.	0
MARK WON	2021-05-25	3	The app is fine except I have to attend meetings with the app(compulsory) while the recordings I have to watch via web (also compulsory)... Put everything on one platform or the other...	16
K K	2021-06-24	1	INVASION OF PRIVACY. Why does it need permissions FOR ACCESS TO ALL MY CONTACTS? Why can't we just select & add any individual Mobile Number from our contact list with whom we wish to chat with? Use is Complicated & confusing. HUGE, Bloated, oversized App 200 MB in size, indicating incompetent App Developers!	5
Chervitha Rayal.Y	2021-06-21	1	I can't find virtual background option and it is not allowing to record untill we deny microphone üé§ option....

EDVIN SOY	2021-05-21	2	The only problem of this app is in a zoom meeting after 40 or 45 minutes the app automatically end the meeting.Host need to start meeting again and want to admit all the participants from beginning.Its too terrible.Please solve this problem.If you solve this you became the best app for a meeting.	1

dz T√òX√éC	2021-05-08	1	Good tool but extremely poor customer service Zoom has demonstrated a complete lack of customer support in addressing issues on their platform. Finds out, they don't really have a customer support dept, since the same person gave me a wrong answer to my issue.	8
happy Hyunjuly	2021-05-26	2	I would give 5 stars if only 2 thing wasn't missing. 1. Put the option of Using Virtual Backgrounds in android too asap. 2. Put option to lock the screen in portrait mode so that it doesn't rotate if I move the phone.	11
Amit Singh	2021-05-02	5	Excellent app üëç Very well designed user interface It's very easy to use Requires low bandwidth and consumes less data THE ONLY PROBLEM it sends me a lot of emails which shows users data for example if I have hundred participants it will send me 100 emails which fill my mailbox THE SOLUTION it could be like one single emale containing list of all the participants and there time of joining and time of leaving in table form if this can be done it would be great	52

Prayas Dumyan	2021-06-07	3	It is a good app. Only one problem is there i.e. it is difficult sign in in this app but I am saying it is good because there is a option of entering name before joining a meeting and in this app we can chat with persons who are in meeting and also we can select one specified person to chat. So it's good app but u should fix this also then will be fantastic app.	16

Just Dance BonGirl	2021-06-18	5	I think zoom is great and a Good idea to watch the Meeting, but I think a new idea feature to add is virtual backrounds but for mobile devices Such as Tablets and Phones. Zoom is the best App ever invented.	4

Sudarshan Kumar	2021-06-05	5	I want to say one thing that if the meeting host can remove a participant and send that person is a spam.

Ken Thompson	2021-04-24	5	5-Stars! Very valuable tool. Must learn by experience. The host needs to put out ID #, Pswd #, and set up breakout rooms at log in BEFORE the meeting starts. Toastmasters are loving this tool! You can attend meetings all over the world.	29

Jhonel Cabagnot	2021-06-05	1	This has lots of bugs. For example, if you use your fb account to sign in, if you have multiple fb accounts in your phone, you cannot use the other fb account to sign in.

meri zindagi mera faisla part 6.0	2021-07-07	1	I think so this app is really just a time pass rather than anything,because whenever I try to join any meetings or whenever I try to create my own meeting,it says me with a notification that you are not eligible for this.so I just want to ask you when will i eligible to join any meeting or to create my own meeting for my business issues?I think so Google meet is more better than these because when in difference with terms of quality, quantity,join meeting and create meetings,meet is excellences!	1

Naitik Aggarwal	2021-05-16	4	Although , it's a good application for meetings but it should give the virtual background option for all mobile phones which are of android 10 , this would make it better . Rest things of this app are good.	1
Aditya Khetarpal	2021-04-29	5	Everything thing is good but the sound quality of any media being played during active meeting (outside zoom app )sounds trash and Zoom registers meeting audio as media audio not call audio which doesn't allow user to reduce meeting volume without reducing media volume being played outside of meeting.	16

J,S nishal	2021-06-08	5	This app is good for meetings. But sometimes this caused voice and video issues. So you have to update it and check the infections in its software. Then it will become the best app for meetings.You have to take care of these things.	5
