Connectivity, sound & audio suck! The	0

Mattias H	2021-07-08	1	The video quality on my Lenovo Tab 11 Pro is good using Skype or the system camera app, but the camera video quality is terrible and unusable in the Zoom app. I don't know if the app is compressing the resolution to death or how it's possible. As there are no video quality settings accessible whatsoever in the Android app, nor support for external USB camera, or even a 'touch up my appearance' feature, I can't find any way to improve it. Please improve the Android app video quality features.	0

Ab Bose	2021-06-30	4	This a good video calling and meeting app but it could be better if you work on the audio. Audio is not supported on, I had problems on meetings on my phone because of overheating so I used my tablet but unfortunately it doesn't seems to support audio, it's very rare that the reciever recieves my voice but is too faint and I have to turn my video off and bring it closer to actually speak. So I request you to please work on the audio problem so it can be compatible with every device.Thank you.	0

Mike Oliver	2021-06-12	2	Clearly the software has problems. For example. Imagine the situation where all the listed participants are setup to have video icons, but NO microphone icons. So,,, what reason justifies the software placing a MUTE ALL button at the bottom of the participant screen? Another situation... On the participant screen someone is listed without a microphone, so WHY should that someone be offered the Join With Audio button? Or if they use the button, why not have the app alert the user of conflict	0

It also kept crashing on me when I tried to add my mobile number, apparently it was always invalid! The settings were also overly complicated. In the end I managed it via the laptop with an app attached to Chrome, and uninstalled the android version altogether.	0

Dylan Patton	2021-04-26	1	Wow what a terrible experience. I will admit that the PC app is fairly smooth, but the phone version is practically useless because of the complete lack of settings when you are in a call. I am unable to use headphones because the audio isn't configured correctly, and the UI is extremely limited when in calls, so I can't even adjust settings, test my audio, change speakers etc.	0

Now, I have to turn on original sound and tuen on a YT video so the voice is better. BUT GUESS WHAT! A few days ago it started to make my teachers voice lower. This is literal hell for me please fix this, I don't have any idea what device to use. I'm so tired I won't be able to use zoom on my android device.	0

Mohit Sahu	2021-05-28	1	The app is all good, and the features are also good. I'm loving it. But the reason I'm giving it 1 star, because there is no option to mute individual from participants side. Here I'm attending class @8:30 am, and getting few unwanted sound from certain people, who's voice can turn your day into a bad day, can say cacophony. Even i can't say the host to mute him, even they certain people don't let anyone else answer. that would have been good, if there were an option so that i can mute them.	0

Leiloni Ontiveros	2021-05-11	3	At first, I thought it was my phone that had issues but it was zoom. When I used to get on zoom for my classes this year, I kept getting thrown off at the important times I needed to be there for. I would miss everything the teacher was saying because it would either glitch, freeze or throw me off zoom. If I don't have the same issues if I have to use zoom again next year, I'll change this rating.	0

Alex Lieb 2.0	2021-06-17	1	I hate this app so much. It is extremely difficult to figure out as a disabled person. I am really getting irrated because it seems there are no apps that has the same use as Zoom or Skype that is easy for an Autistic/ADHD person to figure out. Disabled people are real and we need services too.	0

Beigh Nasir	2021-04-19	1	As the app is very best and helped a lot during the pandemic but one problem I saw was common that android users or those who were without desktop were not able to download or record the meeting and finally I came to know that this option wasn't available. I'm sorry for 1 star coz I need this app and it's sucking me as I'm not able to record meeting. Now the rest is up to app developer. I want this feature. Hope I will see it soon 😇	0

I'm using the same account but it's not working. However I don't like online classes cause that is only wasting of time.	0

I appreciate this but please give us an option to remove our video tab from the speaker view because many a times in blocks the contents part of the screen and many a times it happens that the full screen is important and we need to take a screenshot of that. Also, please insert the option tho resize that tab according to our requirements.	0

Thierry Massihians	2021-06-08	3	I really like zoom. It's my choice platform for online classes, I use it EVERY DAY, and it's way superior to Google meet. But... I have one major complaint: It DRAINS the battery at 4 times the normal rate for online streaming and downloading. I suspect it has killed my tablet's battery in less than a year of use.	0
Shineah Sanchez	2021-04-15	5	The video quality, audio, chatting features as well as screen sharing have always worked adequately. I have no complaints, & I use zoom regularly now - obviously, due to the pandemic & physical distancing mandates. I do appreciate that a user can leave zoom open while searching for/using other apps or windows & the zoom will automatically close the video feature. In other words, no one is looking up your nostrils when you go to look something up real quick in another window.	0

Something like a dialog box to enter the name of each participants and at time to raise hand, the name of the one who want to react will be choosen and appairs for the animator.	0

I thought first that today zoom is crashing a lot so that's why it's not working but when I logged in meeting with my another password it connected immediately. I don't know what's the problem where I can't join in my own device. I hope u fix this immediately.	0

Hesha Sheth	2021-04-18	1	Zoom is like the king of glitches! The amount of problems this app has caused are innumerable but here are a few...it has craploads of responding problems with no solution. Everytime it stops responding I have to restart my laptop and its very irritating. Also it takes up a lot of wifi and I get disconnected very frequently... half of the time I can't switch on my video and the teachers scold me, and they heat up even more when I don't speak...is it my fault if unmuting takes a millennium here!	0

Jennifer Fetherkile	2021-05-12	4	This is the app the Drs at UCSF use to conduct video office appointments. It is easy to use, works great, and has saved us HOURS of driving, in heavy, commuter traffic, for each appointment! I got all of the lab work and imaging done locallu, and I've only had to go down to SF (a 2+ hour drive) for the actual procedure the Dr had to perform. Saved us time, money, wear & tear on our vehicle, and stress, as well as kept us out of the germ- laden close contact of the big city. Love it!	0

Shiroしろ	2021-05-05	2	For some reason zoom keeps disconnecting on my phone constantly. WhatsApp, messenger, Duo, Google meet work completely fine except duo.

I don't have a choice to use other except zoom since I can't convince my professors to use an alternative app. Please fix this.	0

Roll dice and it landed on a 4 and you said... Well 40 minutes should be plenty? This doesnt work for school meeting either. Just dont do it.	0

Piyush Raj 8c 39	2021-06-07	3	Something which i do not like that Co - Host option is not enabled in a Basic user. If the Co - Host option will be enabled in Basic user device, the meeting can be done more easily. We can easily enable the screen share option for a particular participant. Moreover our meeting experience will be better. And i don't think that this option will give any harm. So it's my humble request to our respected Sir/Madam to please discuss on this topic. Co - Host option must be enabled for Basic Users.	0

Christopher Mark Bosher	2021-06-06	1	In use it makes the phone overheat and eventually needs to be shutdown at the request of the phones failsafe. Since Android tablets can be used with zoom too, there should definitely be more options for seeing more than 4 screens. A company should not assume the customers needs but ask. I know so many that use a tablet and hate having only 4 screens. Sort this out please	1

Takes 20 mins to load a meeting, not user friendly (and we're talking a millennial who has used computers and phones their whole life) & the app isnt supported on brand new tablets from 2021 & smartphones from 2020... what the actual hell. Even fb has a better system than you guys- I'm going back to messenger. You can see that zoom clearly doesnt care about spending money to improve the app 🤷‍♀️	0
