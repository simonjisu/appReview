kaylee	2021-05-21	3	Edited: This app is extraordinary and considerable for universities and for institution. I would precisely entirely advise this for everyone for the community who does not or doesn't use zoom. The explanation I provided you 3 stars is that zoom ends up freezing up on my screen for no justificationation for why? I mean my wifi is functioning flawlessly but it appears like your app does not. This frequently goes on on mobile a lot to me so... uhhh rectify your app, originators.	0
Soothing Music	2021-06-10	3	It is a humble request to the creator to create an option so we can unsend the messages during messages. Sometimes by mistake wrong messages are sent in the meetings and we don't even have a option to unsend it. Please bring an update as this is very crucial. Meeting mein galat messages ko unsend karne ka option bana do bhai. Warna galat messages chala jata hai🙏.	0

I can't join the audio on my phone or tablet, which are a 5th of the age of our computer here, no matter how hard i tried. I have tried literally every trick in the book to fix the problem but nope. Its funny how other people i know don't have this problem but i seem to have this stupid issue. The point is, PLEASE FIX THIS!! I know we are all at home constantly, but this shouldnt take almost a year to fix!	0

This is my complaint as well otherwise this app is very useful but only one thing is there is no delete option or unsend message in chat box, that should be provided. Another thing is it consumes a lot of battery of mobile phone or laptop so please be updated with that also. Thank you .	0

Katherine Rubie	2021-04-06	4	I really love this! It's wonderful to stay in touch with people! There is a problem with signals syncing up, so this does make singing at the same time problematic. Maybe 5G will fix this? I've held a successful baby shower, met with politicians, attended church, had meetings, socialized with friends. This app makes a tremendous amount of difference for people who can't get out! It only loses points for having had some security issues (past & present) around privacy.	0

Fadzai Gides	2021-03-17	3	Zoom is a pretty good apps for meetings with family, friends, and school. However, the app doesn't pick up my audio well. My peers have told me that you can't hear me or my audio is low. Also, the device I use it on is a Samsung Galaxy Tab a and I can't go into Gallery mode on it. Overall, it's a good app for communicating with meetings for a lot of different purposes but the tech issues are very annoying.	0

Aaron Presley	2021-02-16	1	Zoom is pure trash because: 1. The system is way too complicated and sometimes malfunctions. 2. At least once per week, it keeps breaking people's headphones, microphone, camera and speaker. 3. It automatically zooms in when I don't want it to do so, especially when someone starts screen sharing and sometimes pressing ESC does not work. Come on, can it get worse? Oh yes it can. 4. Last but certainly most annoying, I keep getting signed out everyday for no reason! Don't even bother using this.	1

Jaco Eduardo	2021-03-05	1	Considering this is so widely downloaded the interface is very basic, a poor effort and looks like something straight out of the late 90's. It's difficult to use on Android. You can only see 4 Windows at a time and no ability to reconfigure that. The stability was good. I don't know who picked the backgrounds. So much potential for creativity there. A plain colour would have been better than those available and the option to zoom in to face to avoid awkward crotch shot.	0

Arilio	2021-02-26	2	It's missing a lot of features that are available on the PC version. You can't pin participants, you can't download or share files in the chat, on tablet it doesn't take advantage of the bigger screen, for some reason your camera closes when you exit the app or even when you open the chat, which doesn't make any sense to me. There are also no different viewing options, like the gallery view on PC. Overall, there's no customizability and it's a much worse version of the PC/Mac application.	0
Tirth Makwana	2021-05-09	1	Why you all create this type of app? We are not able to understand anything in our online classes. This app is good but we can't use this app for educational purposes. If we want to learn anything it should be explained practically not only in theory. And in this app we can't learn practically. So, please stop online classes, not only in this app stop online classes in all the apps. 🙏🙏PLEASE🙏🙏	0

There's just one thing I suggest, maybe zoom could let me schadule a meeting i wanna JOIN at that time. It would be really cool and convenient. So i won't be late in my school. I also love the way that you can chat to your friends even if your not in a meeting. I really want to use video filters and studio effects, but it says my machine is not supported. But, I still love it!	0

I start my phone before meeting at 100% and charge one hour after the meeting. Please update the app if needed. Please fix it as fast as you can. I cannot understand the classes properly. I am a 6th class student.."	0

The Gorrila is a role model and can help with the consistent lag. The game has saved many lives and will help you. You can play while listening to your friends or teacher.	0

So, disappointing😞 If possible please try to resolve this problem. It hampers my performance and attendance in classes. I hope that you'll work on it that's why I gave you 3 star. My expectation was also wrong, so I gave 1 star.	0

Lee G	2021-01-15	1	Image quality and resolution is maybe 720p. It makes it hard to read small text on screen if you are looking at software settings in the course you are learning. At least in you tube when you change resolution from 720 to 1080p, you immediately see the difference and have no problems seeing the text. And this applies to both my Samsung tablet and my 17 inch laptop. Never liked zoom but unfortunately some companies use it to teach courses on.	3

I guess this app has been out for a long time, and the problems have never been fixed. The problems that I have always faced, its still the same or worse. I would use Google Meet LOL.	0

When I could get on, it would show up as a black screen with people thinking I never made it and even not show up. My appointments with drs had to be cancelled because this doesn't work. Maybe it is to weak for my 11x Android phone and made for a 5x Android phone. I Deleted this program and told my drs that they will have to wait until this virus is over to see me in person.	0

Dawn Brink	2021-02-03	5	When I first was introduced to zoom I didn't understand how to enter into a meeting so it was a learning experience for me. I heave very little experience with computers or cell phones, other then to make and recieve text messages or phone calls. I was even new to e-mails and how to do them. But once I figured it out and realized it was all that difficult, I found it a quite enjoyable experience to keep in touch with my sponser and the few other meetings that I was to do regularly.	1

Jason Voorhees	2021-03-12	1	This app is ridiculously broken on mobile, it's audio is automatically turned off and you have to manually turn it on. WHAT KIND OF APP DOES THAT!? Imagine downloading an app where it's main feature/purpose is automatically turned off and you have to manually turn it on, that absolutely makes no sense, it's like call of duty but without shooting and you have to manually turn shooting on in the menu. It's stupid. And turning on the audio is an absolute nightmare. It's a long process. PC is better	1

Dharam Verma	2021-01-14	3	I would like to give it a five-star but I would give it a three-star rating just because there's some problems in it. 1. whenever I see the participants page or minimise the app my video automatically turns off. 2. Sometimes my mic doesn't work even I have turned it on. 3. My audio doesn't connect automatically even when I have changed my settings to 'call over internet' mode. And such some other issues. It would be really great if zoom fixes it and then the app will worth the 5-star rating. TY	0
