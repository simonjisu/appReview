Everything works so perfectly with Skype that people have no idea that I'm using my pc along with a mobile on interviews. Why can't zoom work like this?	151

But there's always room for improvement with technology. The more it can be made to feel like we're in-person the better. The image/document share works good too.	1526

Monaandsteve Sponenberg	2021-05-02	4	"Zoom had been a fantastic tool during Covid 19. However the latest update had hidden the ""Raise hand"" in the ""Reactions"" at the middle of the screen. So now one has to click two things to raise hand and if not called on to comment (or after comment) must click twice to lower hand. Besides that there is increased distance between the ""Raise hand"" and ""mute/unmute"". A small inconvenience multiplied by 100 is a BIG deal. Please fix it!"	1

Please zoom just default it to keep the mic and camera off when joining a meeting.	14

Shyamali Saha	2021-04-13	3	The experience which i had till date is neither good nor bad. Although there are several advantages such as good audio , video , screen appearance and so on , there are few disadvantages as well. For joining it takes quite time and on the other hand you have to give id, passcode and so on.Even if you want to share your voice you have use wifi. Hence , what i want to say is that it is the best virtual meeting app after you join the meeting.	1639

Also, when the draw tool is used on another person's shared screen and you leave the page, such as to use the calculator app, the drawing freeze so that the screen sharer has to clear all drawings.	0

Taliya Asad	2021-05-27	3	Umm....it's, a good app, but, I can't upgrade my account in my tablet. I can upgrade it in my system only! I know that because I have used zoom on laptop as well and there was the option. But, now, my laptop isn't working well so, I use zoom on tablet...... but, that's not even the real reason I gave only 3 stars. Whenever, (on tablet, smartphone or iPhone only) we get a call, and another app is opened, zoom is in the background, I don't receive calls. Same problem with my sisters.Please fix it.	25

Sandra Mora	2021-05-11	4	Zoom is pretty user friendly. Easy to operate, not allot of fussy options to mess with. Automatically set to noise dampening, and cancels out background noise like a champ.... if you WANT your guests to hear background music for example, you need to turn this off. I wish some settings would stay selected like the chime upon arrival, since I want that with every meeting/every guest. Also, the buttons can be fiddley, for example, screen sharing during a meeting. Try it!	35

Vishwanath Bhausahib	2021-06-26	5	Very useful and user friendly aap.	0
Adam Amott	2021-04-21	3	No volume control, but otherwise great. The problem is that it doesn't have a way to control volume like any other voice app available, from Skype to messenger to Google hangouts. The desktop has separate volume control for good reason, but phones have separate media and call volume built in. Yet zoom overrides that and blasts out audio for everyone. Lest this be taken as a complete negative review, I'll add how much I love the chat. It's very organized.	46

Steve Fossey	2021-04-24	1	Recent changes have resulted in frequent crashes, camera conflicts with MS Teams (camera light on but no video and Zoom crashes, checked with multiple scenarios) and a weird bug where the phone keeps ringing if you answer an incoming call on PC. Paid account, I'm the administrator, affects dozens of employees and Zoom's tech support is very limited. Focus on becoming a great business tool or the next snapchat, but not both.	4

Alexander Bunn	2021-04-16	1	Exceedingly poor UI design, ended up having to aplogise and being muted by host in a company wide meeting for joining remotely in an area with a bit of background noise because I was unable to locate the mute control on my end. All I could do was switch between viewing my camera, the active speaker, and all other call participants. In these times it's simply unexcusable for such a vital app like this to have such pathetic UI design.	579

Can be a battery drain/memory hog , especially on laptops + mobile devices, even with tweaked settings. Allows file sharing, recording and variety of meeting host tools to help me manage my meetings + online classes wherever I or my participants might be. Easier account Identification, log in/account switching between multiple accounts would be appreciated.	33

I keep on tapping launch meeting but no response of any kind. I costed me alot. Pathetic app. On the other hand, if I copy paste the link in the zoom app, it says invalid meeting	129

Wonders with Pragati	2021-04-28	3	It shows error everyday atleast in1 class. So you should see towards it that why it is showing like this. Specially whenever i ON my video it starts disconnecting so i really think you should update its video feature so that it can assume very less internet. I hope you can understand and will work. Just because of this problem i am rating it 3 Star other wise this app is fine.	1

PS	2021-05-05	3	A good app and service if you want to hold a large virtual oonference or presentation and have no alternative. Steep learning curve to get right. Not plug and pay for participants. Ok for joining a scheduled conference, poor for adhoc small meetings, horrible for spontaneous video chatting. Roughly comparable to Google Meet but harder to use, with slightly lower quality video and significantly lower quality sound.	12

lovely cooking house	2021-04-13	5	It's a good app for video call but the limited time is disturbing. And if we want to fix it then we have to pay money. But it is not fair for everyone because all people can't pay money. So if you increase the time limit then it will be really helpful for us. Now the time limit is 40 minutes. If you please increase it 10 minutes more. I think it will be great.	42

Manoj Das	2021-04-17	1	Very bad app! If we join a meeting with our video switched on,then the internet overs very fast. Now,this app is used for Online Classes also. So,when the teachers ask us to switch on our video,and then we have to switch on our video. It uses data very fast, if video is switched on. And also,if the video isn't switched on,then also it uses the data very fast. As compared to the TEAMS app, it is much better than ZOOM. As it uses only 50M.B in 40 minutes,and ZOOM uses 150 M.B in 40 minute!üë∫ü§¨üò°üò†	52

To have access to the very fundemental polls feature, you'll have to fork over $$$$$ and pay for the premium service as it isn't available on any other payed subscription tier.

Kevin Brookes	2021-02-22	4	Great for teaching Karate, lots of features & I discover something new, every now & then. The only feature missing, which should not be hard to implement, is to mirror the video of the instructor to the students. You can mirror your own video, but not that which others see. The reason this would be useful is because students, especially kids, learn by imitating what they see, so when we put our right hand out, they automatically put there left hand out, as for them, it is like looking mirror.	2888

indu shiva	2021-04-22	5	Its a very cool app. But I really had a problem with network. It's consuming a lot of network and apart of this it's a great app video clarity, audio,screen share and all are cool	10
Michelle Wilson	2021-04-21	5	Zoom has been a wonderful vehicle to maintain my relationships with my family and friends. The video is always clear and scheduling meetings are a breeze. I have been able to share my screens which allows a more professional appearance.	1
Just A Guy	2021-02-03	2	Just awful. How hard can it be to make this thing work correctly. Audio is highly inconsistent, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Completely random as far as I can tell. If you touch the screen in the wrong place (I have no idea where), the meeting that you're in completely disappears and some random configuration screen appears, and you cannot CANNOT get back to your meeting. Its mind boggling... how long has Zoom been around. Fortunately, the desktop version works fairly well, but the Android version is just terrible. I guess none of the developers actually use it themselves. FYI, I've had these and other problems on out of the box, totally stock Google Pixel phones, (2XL and 4A5G)	1087

Jon Chantry	2021-02-13	4	Overall good app for what it is. It's not the best communication service, but its ease of integration for classes make up for most of its faults. The one thing I'd like to see added is the ability to mute and turn down other users while you are not the call leader. Many times I've had inconsiderate classmates, or quiet teachers, that I'd like to adjust their volume without interrupting the rest of the class. Phasmophobia, an indie video game, has these controls integrated. Zoom can too.	2710
Kingsley Egeonu	2021-07-01	2	I have two accounts that I pay for yet zoom keeps cutting my meetings after every 40 minute in the two accounts.	0
Sam Clark	2021-01-25	1	This app is terrible when it comes to managing sound. When I cast my screen, the audio continues on my phone instead of going to the external device. If I'm just on my phone, the audio might randomly start on my watch. If I need to mute the sound, it won't mute completely. Some sound is always trying to leak through. This is the only app I've ever seen behave this way. I'm glad that Zoom provides a platform for convenient communication, but the app is riddled with bugs.	1178

ANAND SIR	2021-04-13	4	Very good experience with zoom app but few things should be added such as attendence sheet, identification of member who writes during pdf sharing, Monthly record of members. As most of the teachers are using it. New features should be added for teachers use.	6

Gerald Joe	2021-04-13	3	Ubiquitous app for many public meetings, concerts, talks, theatre, dance shows etc. While feed can be sent to YouTube where the event can be viewed on almost any device, Zoom itself is not usable with devices like VR headsets and Bluetooth speakers. The audio for music is good (supports wired 5.1 speakers). Finicky set up for user as spectators and event organizers (user photo, background, ...)	22

Ayush Mankame	2021-01-28	2	It was working exceptionally well until the update. Before update, I was able to listen songs or music at the background even when my meeting was going on on my phone. Yes, the music quality doesn't come out good while in a meeting, but it used to come. But nowadays, after the update, whenever I play a song or video, the bluetooth headsets automatically gets disconnected and the voice comes out from the ear speaker of the phone. And it doesn't get connected quickly to the headsets again.	880

Again if you some how connect it to the device during a meeting and then if you go to another app it will disconnect. Please try to fix this.	1726

Ch. Sri Laasya	2021-02-22	5	Very impressive app. You can use this app for meetings from any countries. But one meeting ends only after 40 minutes. If you you want more than 40 minutes you should uprade to premium. Then you can use meeting for long hours. You can also use it for online classes. This is my review for this app. I recommend this app. This app works fast only. It's not slow working app. Can add more features this is my suggestion.	1113

Many times I have to connect my charger just to get through 1¬Ω hour meetings when I started with 100%. After update I can do virtual backgrounds (Yay!). Can't start a meeting of my own, only can join. Can't even find a way to sign out and sign back in again. What's up with that? Updated on another device and no option for virtual backgrounds again. Was able to use them before, but now it does not even show.	17260

Please keep up the good work. however, it would be nice if you add the playback feature to your settings, where one can still listen to a video even when he minimize the app, as it will be playing on the background. It will be very useful. For now, if one shares a video and your minimize your screen, it stops. Please look into this feature. It will add more efficiency to your work	7881
Timothy Wood	2021-05-12	2	Poor user interface... amazing what you get for free	0
Nicole Carlson	2021-02-24	4	So far this app has proven effective. The video is clear & fast, has minimum technical issues when starting up and throughout the user experience. Minimal sound issues. Overall it's a great app. I use it often for professional & personal use on a weekly basis. The one thing I would change about this app is if there was a way to make it so it didn't drain my phone battery. I have to keep it plugged in the entire time I'm using the app but it doesn't charge my phone, just keeps it from dying.	853

Cici Col	2021-01-28	1	When there's video playing through screen share, the sound disappears when I try to go to another app to take notes. It doesn't play the video's audio in the background like it used to. Also, when I'm connected to a bluetooth headset, the audio of the video playing during the meeting is still coming out of the phone, but the voices of the other people in the call goes through the headset. The sound coming out of the phone isn't even the original sound, it's like a weird tiny staticky sound.	724
Muthusamy Kasthuri	2021-04-23	1	This is app is so heavy and taking a lot of data my tab is lagging so much. I think the app only good for it option of features for that only I can give 1/5.

Mimp J	2021-01-26	4	Works fine via phone. Prefer over laptop as there are more options and settings, but this is a good substitute when on the go. A better UI for easier access and nicer outlook would be the reason why I'm giving this 4 stars. I couldn't find a way to rename myself properly in another language. It keeps coming out in the wrong order. Sometimes it wouldn't connect to audio properly either. Please kindly look into this. Thanks!	882
Jillian Craig	2021-04-05	5	I love this app! I use it for dance and after school chats with friends! Yes, some times it's laggy. But that's just the internet! After school, I love it. I have so much control. One day, my teacher was away and we needed to make a call for school. I made a zoom and the whole class had good internet and we got though ALL our work! Also, I see there's a few people who can't start meetings. You need an account! THANK-YOU ZOOM!	5067
Samuel Sylvester Cole	2021-04-24	5	Best social media app for audio and video conferencing. üëè But recent usage is not efficient as it keeps going off, prompting you to rejoin. Check it.	1
Imran Bin Aboobacke r	2021-03-06	5	Very awesome. Not only that it is awesome it can be used for official or just friendly meeting. It is so great and i have been using it for about a year now. I started using it from march. But the only problem for me is that whenever i share screen something in my class(am a student by the way) i just leave from my meeting. So someone said that if we reset the settings ( not factory reset) then it wud work. Surprisingly, it worked but only for the first screen share. The second time it didnt.	5170

Jannateen Nayem	2021-01-18	4	It's a great app. I really like it. It's user-friendly, and the host has a lot of control over the participants. It is possible to chat with people, but the host can control who the participants can chat with. It is possible to chat publicly or privately with only the host or privately with another participant. Virtual backgrounds enable you to put on an artificial background if your background is not suitable for a meeting. Different and fun filters are available now.	626
Weirdo Nerd-	2021-04-19	1	Firstly i give this app five stars. But now, i am having trouble. I am unable to join meeting. My Wi-Fi connection is too good but i can‚Äôt join a single meeting. I am having problems. Please fix this. I am drawing the attention of developers-	49

S Barvenik	2021-02-21	1	At first Zoom might seem okay. Its used commonly now that covid restrictions are up. However this app contains an abundance of problems, especially with mobile. In fact, do not even try downloading it on mobile. Its a waste of time. Genuinely. It doesnt work, it just keeps saying connecting. It is a poor attempt at something that would be used for any purpose other than to annoy your coworkers. This app deserves less than 3 stars.	819
vivek karam	2021-05-13	5	Good one though..could do better with better UI	0
Yoleine Tamari	2021-02-18	5	"This a learning process for me. I never did zoom before, until the school that I was attended Spring-2020. When Covid hit. We had to make the transition, between classroom learning and transferred us on zoom. It tokes me 3 weeks of plenty of errors, to get a hold of it. We just started the second semester, of 2021- I am still lost sometimes, but I am much better and comfortable now then a year ago. I cannot imagine where we all will have been without""Zoom"". üëç Thank you! Yolein,"	950

GT Technology	2021-05-31	1	A very useful app for student. I'm satisfied	0
Barney the messiah	2021-02-11	3	My school uses it and everything is perfect. But on Android, you cannot pin someone. Wich is kinda bothering. You cannot pin your teacher, so if you want to copy something, you need to wait for your classmates to stop talking then wait for your teacher to speak. You can have multiple screens tho, but it's useless since the teacher's screen will be small.	921
beni - san	2021-02-18	2	"It's pretty good... But it's pretty bad at the same time. Whenever I try to rejoin a meeting again, I always cannot join. And sometimes, even if I have strong wifi, the loading time is very slow. Please also fix the audio and video quality of share screen. It's absolutely very horrible and bad. Overall, a pretty ""meh"" rating for a video call app. Hopefully it can do better."	809
Neet Kaur	2021-04-20	2	Network issues actually I have a good network connection in my area but whenever I join a meeting the teachers voice stops and all screens of students and teacher turns blank and after few seconds my class gets disconnected and then it remains connecting again and again if it connected I can't hear teacher's voice it needs a high network but in our the network speed is 2-3 mbps per second and even if u wear Bluetooth headphones u don't get voice its so irritating üôÑ	1

MH 04	2021-02-02	1	The zoom app has been sitting and spinning for 20 minutes and I'm late for a class that I'll now have an absence in. It's not the internet because it can run multiple devices with no lag whatsoever. This includes a TV, three phones, and a desktop computer. But the second Zoom opens, it does nothing but spin. Fix. This. Issue. Now. (I've been seeing Zoom isn't very keen on the idea of reading and resolving any of these issues but this won't keep me from sharing my horrible experience)	692

Arun Bhargava	2021-02-13	4	Good App. I have paid subscription. There is a problem, which I ask Zoom team to address. Every participant can mute himself / herself. But, if I want to mute the zoom application, and do not want to listen the audio of meeting, because - I am simultaneously working on another program, I can not mute the app / program on my mobile / Laptop. Please correct this problem.	1202
Nisha Kumari	2021-04-22	5	Very nice app We can use it for classes and meetings I am very happy as I am a teacher from Delhi public school But... You should also available a feature of Seeing what students are watching in the time of meeting Regards Zoom	0

Pulkit Singh	2021-04-29	1	Very bad quality video call indeed I have a very high internet speed	0
PotatoWhyMe	2021-03-14	2	When I first started zoom, everything was fine. That was untill, I opened the app one day, it asked me to make an account. I already had an account, there was no 'log in' option. This happens atleast once or twice every few months and it's really annoying and irritating. Also, sometimes when I'm in a meeting, the person on the other side of the call can't hear me, at all, even when I was UNmuted (My mic was on, but that could probably just be my device/ internet). Hope you fix my first problem.	1894

Zack Shields	2021-03-16	3	It's a decent video call app, but the message feature does not work well. There's an option where the messages appear over the video call, but the disappear in 3 seconds. Then I have to leave the video screen to read the message. It just feels like I'm switching screens constantly, and it's tedious. I'd love it if they'd add a split screen feature -- the bottom half of my screen is the messages, and the top half is the video.	1023

Only improvement: Would be nice to have the option to see more than 1 person video at the time like you offer it on the computer. Same if the video is small. Some people like me, would love to be able to see 6 people at the same time instead of one by one. Quality of video, sounds are really good. Great to have the 40min free service.	1018

Ambrossia P. Williams	2021-03-01	4	Great app for PANDEMIC work meetings (1 year and counting,) as well as connecting with friends and family.

No dropped video calls or interruptions. Now, if I just could have access to all the ZOOM background scenes, via mobile, while on meetings, this would be icing on the cake!	974

Misty Headrick	2021-04-03	3	Have had several meetings through zoom...it was okay...it was a bit confusing when I could hear someone talking but couldn't see them!! It should have a better way to focus on the person talking when having a bigger zoom group meeting...I'd have to scan through all the people before I could focus on the person who was actually talking...instead of searching for them & trying to write notes about the meeting at the same time!!	3236

Nathaniel Zieg	2021-02-01	1	This is a good app other than the fact that the host can pay to be able to hear people when they are muted That's a violation of privacy, and I'm not changing how many stars until this is changed a reason why someone would have their mic muted is because there's something happening that they want others not hearing for example, my family is not very stable, there's a lot of arguing that happens, and I learned that my teacher knows that. I do not want them to know that. That's private. change it.	1838

Phone volume was all the way up. It kept showing at the bottom to join audio but whenever I would click it it would just keep popping up with call over internet. Even when I turned my wifi off to just use data and back on again. What's the point of an app for a meeting if I can't even hear anyone else???	745

Peter K	2021-01-14	1	This is hands down, the WORST video calling app I have ever had. First of all, it's so laggy, and when I call people I can't even see them because most of the time their screen is frozen. The next thing is that when I try to create a zoom account , its says I cant create one right now. I have already told my family and friends how bad of an app this is and that they should never download this app. Please fix this garbage app.	1679

But really common Trolls get a life or go back under the bridge from which you came.	461
Sally Richardson	2021-03-12	4	Connections are fairly easy, however, the sound quality is not what it needs to be. Fading in an out sound, it's difficult to hear and understand what is being said. Update: We attend daily classes on Zoom, some classes are easy to get onto, and others not so much. It is frustrating attempting to get into a class and the correct password is not accepted over and over again. I am not sure what the password connection issue is, Hopefully it will be corrected. 3/11,2021 sp2	998

Ly Satheapech	2021-03-19	4	I love this app. However, there is one problem that i can't give 5 stars. Because when we use zoom link, we can use only 40 minutes only. When we use zoom ID, we can use a limited of time until the host accept to end the zoom. So, I want you to update on zoom link to make a limited of time like zoom ID and it isn't hard for teacher to send other link. That's all I wish and I'm begging to you to do it right now.	576

It's unfortunate when there is a Slowdown in the programming and it can't compensate , lagging, freezes and shutdown with restarts, only 4 participants, I've tried both Wi-Fi and cellular for internet providers, so providers aren't the problem , it is definitely a problem with the program , rectify that and you get 5 stars from everyone.	1630

K.	2021-03-25	5	4.5 ‚≠ê this app is the best option for video conference. it is not perfect, but I find it better than Meet. Firstly, it has room options, which is just great. Secondly, it lets you have any name inside the meeting, unlike Meet that always shows your Google account name. This feature is great for public meetings when you don't want anyone to see your name. But there's room for improvement: no history of previous meetings; can't open the app to see schedule etc without leaving the ongoing meeting.	4083

Karen Klopfer	2021-02-04	1	Google meet has live captioning. Microsoft Teams has live captioning. If you care about accessibility use a different app. Zoom has had plenty of time to respond to people with hearing disabilities and has done nothing to make this accessible. Update:just talked to zoom billing. Their typical personal account is about $15 per month. They want $65 per month for their cheapest option with live captioning. Don't you think that's discriminating against people with hearing loss?	41
John W	2021-06-12	5	Very effective on a range of devices.	0
Michael Habermann	2021-02-18	1	Horrible. Was working quite well on the old tablet. Now, I'm using it on a Tab 8 8.4 and the sound is broken. As if people are 5 blocks away, then one moment later they are in the same room. People can't hear me, then they can. Volume is too soft and I have all turned up to maximum. Sound is distorted. Used WiFi then 4G then reset tablet then reconnected - they did the same. Could the problem be Android 9? I have to switch back to the old tablet of 5 years ago. At least Zoom works reliably.	816
Emediong Monday	2021-04-20	1	At first, it's was working well with bluethoot earbud/headset but now I find it difficult to listen with my headset, but I use the headset for other audio/video app except this zoom app why?	0

Mary Bradford	2021-03-02	1	I liked zoom before the last update. Now it shows others and I can hear them but they cannot hear or see me. I have to use my mobile hotspot to connect at all. The house wifi doesn't work on zoom but it does on google meets. It makes it hard to teach. Please fix the connection problems. I need it to work for my classes. Please make it so there is no time delay. I teach music. The time delay is frustrating.	766

Christopher Anderson	2021-01-16	4	Very good most of the time. My only complaint is on a couple of occasions when used for large group discussions, I have found myself looking at a screen showing which persons have their microphones muted and who has then on, instead of seeing the screen which the instructor of the meeting is currently showing. Trying to get back to the right screen can be frustrating, especially when you don't know why you're not seeing it. With this one exception, I zoom is otherwise a 5 star program .	129
AM Brother's	2021-01-30	1	It was working exceptionally well until the update. Before update, I was able to listen songs or music at the background even when my meeting was going on on my phone. Yes, the music quality doesn t come out good while in a meeting, but it used to come. But nowadays, after the update, whenever I play a song or video, the bluetooth headsets automatically gets disconnected and the voice comes out from the ear speaker of the phone. And it doesn t get connected quickly to the headsets again.	1080
Ifroon Aryok	2021-03-01	1	If you use this on your phone only, you're good but if you've used it on a computer. This app is worth detesting, it lacks as much as the desktop version has. Heck, you can't even flip your video. Do I have to use my rear camera to get a non-reverse image? You know what, I'm not even gonna try to count. IT IS PLAINLY HORRENDOUS! I would give it a zero star rating if I could, you guys have put no effort in the android app.	867

Vanessa Ascher / Flautista	2021-03-19	5	Great app and product. The only thing I dislike compared to other video call apps is that if there are any ambient sounds (keyboard tapping, page turning, coughing, etc.), the sound will automatically drop out, and you have to mute the mic in order to avoid having the sound cut constantly. Otherwise, the screen sharing function is very useful and allows you to anotate as you share your screen, and the meetings are saved so that you can see your meeting schedule for the meetings you create.	567

Mariam Amod	2021-01-14	4	It allows only one speaker at a time so there's the matter of not hearing anyone else, as a disadvantage. There's also a delay so their first words are usually lost. But if you get the hang of it, it's a good app in terms of video and sound quality, for multiple users. I would like to see an improvement in the quality of international zoom meetings. The sound from abroad sometimes has a lot of static, especially if a mic is being used	2077

I'll stick with the pc version	992
ColbyWasTaken	2021-03-30	1	I usually don't write reviews, but when I do, its something that either annoys me greatly or it just causes so many problems to the point it just doesn't work. This app just constantly breaks on every device I have. It either doesn't respond or it just straight up won't join the meetings because its just this bad. I guess this app has been out for a long time, and the problems have never been fixed. The problems that I have always faced, its still the same or worse. I would rather use Skype lol	1707

Denis Udall	2021-01-26	3	When it works........ I use Zoom for a mutual support group. I'm paying for the pro version. I use it on windows 10 Been trying to help a friend who's as long paying for pro but is on Chrome. The options on meeting and account setup are in entirely different places. There is zero human being support. I'm in the UK, she's in USA, so we end up looking at each other's laptop screens over Facebook Messenger. If Zoom is prepared to take our money, with no support, at least have a common interface.	702

SURAJ SINGH 1248	2021-04-17	1	Worst app. It has too many bugs which never get fixed. When a screen is shared we can pen on it but if we click on that option and then close it after that we are unable to remove pen and whenever we zoom in or zoom out screenshare pen is used on the shared screen and becomes not clearly visible due to the pen üñäÔ∏èüñäÔ∏è...

Darren Martin	2021-02-05	1	This app would be incredible if there weren't so many steps to getting it done. When in Google Duo or Viber or FaceTime, as long as the contacts have each other's number or information, one person calls another person and voila!!!! In Zoom an email has to be sent or a text message, or both. I have searched numerous videos on how to EASILY use Zoom and the number of steps involved is beyond ridiculous!!!!	754

Meenakshi Saravanakumar	2021-01-22	4	I think that Zoom is a really great virtual meeting application and I really admire how much effort they put into making the interface user-friendly and accessible but I feel that sometimes the app can be kind if finicky as compared to the computer version which is why I decided to give it a four. It really isn't the apps fault or anything so I can't really pinpoint any one specific thing to change but overall, this was my just my experience.	571

Virginia Wright	2021-02-28	4	I like Zoom, but there is a bug that needs to be fixed. I blocked one of my contacts by accident, and we sent each other contact requests so we could be contacts, but it's not showing up. Also, with Apple mobile devices, you can do virtual backgrounds and filters. But that isn't on the Android version. Otherwise, good app.	489
Gaurav Guldagad	2021-05-30	1	Zoom meeting host doesn't have any right to observe the background of the users. During meeting the camera of the user is been ON so there is no requirement of visualising the background of the users. Give some privacy to the users....	1

I have had as many as 50 attendees at some of these meetings. Everyone has been very pleased with the mix. Zoom has saved my life and many others during this pandemic. I'm eternally grateful üôè üòå. Randall Hamm Leavenworth KS.	496
Athira Sivarajan	2021-01-28	2	App is good for meetings but it has some problems like it doesn't allow split screen facility and if we use any other app in the background, the video will shut off. Moreover, it doesn't even facilitate any Bluetooth services in the background like if you'll try to watch any video in the background, the audio will not be played in the earphones and it will automatically be changed to speaker mode. There are better apps available like google meet which doesn't have the above mentioned problems.	866

Starry Seas	2021-02-02	2	I'm having issues getting into any zoom with a password. I put in the zoom I'd as usual but, when it requires for me to put a password it doesn't work. I have missed class for this issue that happens pretty often. I even asked the people who created the zoom meeting the password and what I was putting in was correct. I also have an issue answering my friends calls. I press accept and nothing happens so I am forced to go into the app just to answer a call. Lots of freezing and low volume.	495
tsering angmo	2021-02-16	1	Zoom is one of the best app for meetings and online classes.

I tried everything to make it work and for that I even uninstalled it many times. I don't know how to make it work. I have classes to be attend on daily basis. Kindly suggest me a solution forr the same. Since its not working on my mobile I have to open laptop everytime just because of this issue. Thank you.	1655

Solid. üëç * 10/2020 * Zoom has become required for daily use and the functionality and features are up to par considering demand. Overall impressed. And again, for basic needs they are doing what they advertise. We can only hope their security is fixed and people's calls aren't getting bombed too much. I appreciate they offer a free basic membership."	45

Thanks!	146
Uche Godwin	2021-02-12	5	Very good tool for virtual meetings . Covid-19 has proved zoom to be excellent. Recently, the app seems not to be working properly during screen sharing. During normal call or talk, the audio crashes, sound not heard. With some GSM networks, logging in to meeting become difficult. It might be your app does not work properly with3G phones. Put more efforts to resolve audio issues as it is the most important thing in Zoom meetings.	504

Jon Linville	2021-01-23	5	Simple to use on a variety of platforms. Lots of uses for personal and business needs. Purchased the pro version allowing our church group to engage in extended worship, discussion and fellowship. Also allows individuals who now live many miles from church family and friends to take part in activities. It does require someone to step up and be responsible for organizing and executing gatherings. All in all, a really good tool anyone can learn to use with just a little effort.	256

My internet was slow last week, this week it's already fixed but zoom still says ""uNaBle tO CoNnEct"" and it's driving me insane since I just missed my frickin class. ONCE you fix this, I'll give you 4 stars, not 5, 4 STARS cuz there's a 50/50(?) chance this will continue even after you ""fix it"", if you ever actually do."	42

WENDY COLLINGTON	2021-02-22	5	The best thing since slice bread within the current season of the lockdown for months upon end. Choose to stay connected and not fall into the moods and downward spiral of depression. Plus use the games to help sharpen your own state of mind. Just train and motivate yourself to do and act better as everyone is experiencing something differently. Be patient with your partner and remember to be kind and forgiving when mistakes happen. Yes, I practice what I preach for I too understand, bless	468
Alison Smith	2021-01-17	4	Fairly intuitive, integrates with my Google calendar and good call quality. Much better than Skype even with the (small) cost I pay to upgrade for extra features in Zoom. My only wish was for a less steep learning curve to know how to help others quickly and easily join calls. This is getting easier with newer updates to the app. 2021-01: Have dropped a star due to complaints from those I meet with--mainly that Zoom is too complicated and some guests have at least one issue every time they join.	23
Ralph Uy	2021-03-05	3	There are a lot of improvements needed in the android version of the application. To compare the app against windows and apple, the android version seems to be neglected in terms of features. It lacks gallery view, no show always meeting controls, chat is full screen and cannot be opened on the side of the meeting, and lack floating video from different users in the meeting.	955
Georgianna Valle	2021-03-11	2	I have been using zoom for the last two years at first I was able to connect to meetings without any problems. Recently every single time every Wednesday and Saturday I log into zoom meeting unfortunately I have been kicked off so many times. Can there be a solution. I have to be at these weekly meetings every week and I am frustrated I can't use it as before. Before there was no issues	738
Liz Allen	2021-02-03	3	Since last update it won't let me log in. whether I do it manually or via the email link it asked for the password both times. when I type in the password it says it's incorrect. last week it happened twice in a row. I have three days where I used the same Zoom link consecutively out of those 3 Days 2 didn't work. then just today it happened again. no matter if I relogin, reload, reboot, or do anything I can't get to my zoom meetings. Please fix soon. Tried on several different devices.	73

Jihoon Oh	2021-03-27	1	Bluetooth headsets/earbuds don't work at first. When I connect Bluetooth headsets and join a Zoom meeting, no sound is coming out of the headsets. The speaker icon shows Bluetooth icon next to the speaker. I have to change it to phone speaker then back to Bluetooth by clicking the speaker icon on Zoom. This issue does not happen to any other app. Also phone speaker volume is too low sometimes. I have to force close Zoom and open it again and the sound volume is louder. I think it's a bug.	716

Perhaps this situation will improve as the 5G network improves. Thank you	37

Kenneth Fleming	2021-03-10	1	I really wish this app dealt with audio better. I'm a musician, and when I'm using zoom to learn and listen to music from a link, this app will start playing audio from the phone and not my bluetooth headphones, and then theres no way to fix that unless I leave and rejoin the call which is extremely inconvenient. Bluetooth suck too, if I dont join a call with it on, I wont hear anything from the headphones unless I leave and rejoin. Really inconvenient.	184
Tenura Dasanayaka	2021-06-27	5	Very nice app. please tell how to video change background on android	0
Trey Pickett	2021-01-21	4	Zoom brings a great option for business and virtual connectivity. I appreciate this app. It does have glitches that may be microphone, freezing, and sometimes the whole site may stop. These things may be due to high demand. Lastly zoom could use more ways to orchestrate and be more fun your youth. Maybe adding in abilities for the host to give a more immersive experiences. Such as cooler reactions, more options other then virtual background, maybe add sequencing, or user customization options.	24
Steven Hill	2021-02-11	3	Frustrating. Default settings should be at least set so that you can go into a meeting and it work properly. I joined a meeting and could see everyone but I could not hear them and they could not hear me. I ended up leaving the meeting and missing out. The app should come with sensible defaults. Instead it is set up by some moron.	107

nutty butty	2021-02-03	1	My teachers put a link to go to zoom. Normally I'll click on it using my computer, sign in, then go to the meeting. However, due to circumstances I have to download this app on my phone and go to the links that way, but instead of my simply clicking on the link and signing in, it will continually ask me to sign in over and over, while never bringing me to my meeting. This makes things inconvenient and hard to manage. It also causes me to be late to my periods.	68

The UI looks outdated, the audio turns off by itself when you close the app if the zoom logo wasn't in the notification bar and the worst part is that when the host ends the meeting, there's this pop up in my screen saying ""Host has ended this meeting"" Why tho? It's a popup, ok so what's wrong? The wrong thing is that the popup comes over any app and as it pops up, the app running will stop it's ongoing process. Please fix this üòê."	916

Wild Liger White Wolf	2021-04-24	5	I always use zoom to study. I love it because I can meet my classmates. You are the host when you open your own zoom. You can share your screen.	3
Kyle Gabriel Norada	2021-03-21	3	Sometimes when I would turn off my microphone on a weak internet connection, other participants can still hear me. Also, please include an option where I can choose the prefered video resolution so I can control the amount of data I would use in a meeting. It is still good, though. My school also uses this platform for online classes.	656
Musathik majid	2021-06-30	5	100 percent use full and very good	0
J BdeC	2021-02-10	5	Please implement an option for the host and co-hosts to disable a participant's microphone on an individual basis. Some participants, for whatever reason, accidentally turn on their microphone and interrupt the meeting. It would be handy to be able to have just that person disabled, without having to disable ALL participants ability to activate their own microphone, or without having to remove them.	201

Suyash Anurag	2021-02-26	1	Please don't rotate screen if the auto rotate of the device is turned off. I'm having very much of trouble. At least put a option to change the settings. App also has no idea about audio focus while using a bluetooth headset. Once another app uses audio the settings doesn't revert back to zoom making it either a earpiece or speaker. Feedback has already been sent to the developer 1 month ago.	125

Carol Koga	2021-06-01	5	I have done a couple of interviews on zoom, a little bit hard to understand at first. It definitely worth it to learn how to use the app..	0
Carl Carroll	2021-01-30	5	Great app for online school. One thing I would like to see is time stamps for video recording so that when students review a recorded lecture they can skip to the specific part where their problem is. Example: of my lecturer recorded a lecture on zoom on the solar system and I'm watching the recording I would like to be able to skip to part where they speak about uranus and not have to skim through the whole video. These time stamps can be placed by the person recording the video.	92
Barry Toone	2021-04-16	4	My second time on my tablet,but am struggling to get it to work on my lap top,not going to employ a geek,so just use the tablet,but its very clear and works a treat.	2
Jericho D	2021-03-10	1	When using BT device (Galaxy Buds), and you remove them from your ears, the audio automatically transfer to device audio (phone speakers). That's fine, however, there is no option to reconnect my buds. The speaker button on Zoom during calls only connects to my phone speakers, it does not allow me to choose my buds. Only way to reconnect is to leave the conference and redial, which is an absolute pain. Will change rating once fix is available.	728
Philip Drelich	2021-02-26	5	It is very good for a small class with the give and take between participants. In these times Zoom is a blessing, especaly for thse who are still still in quarinten.and elderly. Thank you! In the last few week zoom seems to have gotten better. If zoom keeps this up I will have to give it 5 stars. Please keep it up. Zoom is improved since I last revued it. I now happly give it five stars. Thanks Zoom.	20
Michelene Decorah	2021-04-14	5	God bless zoom. Zoom is the only telephonic audio and video calls I receive from my son. Without zoom I'd never be able to see my son. Thank you google and zoom. God bless America üôèüôèüòá	1
Andrea McKeithan	2021-04-16	4	Works good most times. Sometimes participants are unable to connect when there are no peripheral changes in their environments. Thank you!	2
Suresh Atk	2021-01-15	5	"Zoom is really useful for online chating ! Video quality and sound quality is good. You should download the app ! But sometimes there is some problem while joining the meeting . ""Host has not started the meeting"" even when meeting is started , but it happens only ones and problem was solved in next 24 hours . Good App ! You should download !"	725

Shamil Hemasinghe	2021-02-06	1	Takes way too much RAM. All 6GB of RAM on my phone is exhausted when zoom is running and my phone crashes. Only experienced this issue with the zoom app. Never has my phone slowed down for anything else. Please fix this ASAP. Also audio doesn't work properly when connected to Bluetooth devices. Audio keeps switching to mobile speakers.. I only use this app because my institute uses this, if not there are much more better optimised apps for mobile which serves the purpose.	1292

HMJ	2021-02-08	5	It's a nice app. Initially I had given 4 stars for the video issue but now I am giving 5 stars to the ZOOM app bcoz at last u resolved the video issue. But i have an issue that now in the participants list the video icon shows on but when we switch to other app for an important work the video goes off. The video should not get off,it should just PAUSE plz plz Kindly solve this issue. Otherwise, Its a great app !!!!!!	105
