Robert Huber	2021-03-17	1	Bluetooth headphones do not work on this app. Everytime I have my bluetooth headphones connected and try to use zoom, it forces audio through my phone. I have tried everything. Looks like zoom wants to blame our devices but it's clearly a bug within the app. Please look into this and stop telling people it's their equipment that's failing. Your app has a bug, acknowledge it and fix it.	653
Jdm Dt	2021-04-15	1	To be honest, my experience with zoom has been horrible it could be better. Lots of faulty and slow. It could be better, A LOT BETTER!	1
Aadarsh Yadav	2021-02-13	4	This app is very good .I can attend all my online classes very easily. I want to give this app 5 star rating but there is a problem or a bug ,glitch when I open my camera it shows off in the participant list . I have uninstalled and downloaded, updated many times but it never solve. So please resolve it and I will give it 5 star . Please and very good app . Thank you.	107
06Luuis	2021-01-15	4	This app is really good it's helped me get through school but the only thing I dislike is not being able to use a gif as your profile picture because I feel that gives us a little diversity and can help each other look more unique. There's a kid in my class that has one but I don't know how he did it. PLEASE ADD THIS AS A FEATURE!!!!!	494
Lim Wei Bin	2021-03-04	4	Zoom cannot change profile pictures now. I don't know if it was the update problem, or my connection (although I have a excellent signal). Still, if it was a bug, I hope Devs will fix it. Tq. By the way, Zoom is a convineient app and its pretty useful but not for low end phones since it can decrease your battery faster than mid range phone 2020. I have this issue before, but now I changed my smartphone From Huawei to Samsung. And luckily its reliableüòÑ.	748
Tushar Pera	2021-04-21	5	A very nice app for meetings. It has all the features which we would like to have in every cloud meeting app. Great work üôèüôè	1

Tanishq nautiyal	2021-05-15	1	Worst app ever,useless updates still audio issueüò†	0
Andrew Boniface	2021-02-01	4	"App apparently commandeers volume control so that incoming meeting audio cannot be completely muted. ... Alteration of volume menu appears to be permanent after uninstalling, this is unacceptable. App should notify about all changes before making each change while installing, and provide for reverting any change individually as nevessary. Addendum, some months later: I discovered a ""disconnect audio"" function, it does the trick, but it is hard to find when you need it quickly."	30

Margot Rusmanis	2021-03-04	2	Not very good for music teaching as instruments playing high notes spawn background noises on Zoom and it takes too much time acknowledging the transition from speech to music so the first musical notes after speech are always lost. Very frustrating! 8/2/21. Still the same problems, I wish there was an app related to musical sound instead of speech. All musicians are having a problem with this. 4/3/21 no change!	258
Sneha's Little World	2021-02-09	5	This is a nice meeting app and ever since the start of the covid pandemic I have used it to stay in touch with my friends and to attend my school's online classes. This is an exceptionally nice app. Hats off to the creators ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üëç. I highly recommend to everyone to install this app. I love it!!! Most of the people writing negative reviews, either do not have a strong connection or do not have knowledge of the software.	126

Paula Clarke-Hill	2021-05-12	5	Still doing an awesome job...... Exceptional video meeting service. Love it.	0
Camelia Blair	2021-02-03	3	I don't like that it have time limits, I think it should verify if we are going to be doing school so that if we're doing school we should not be able to change our back ground because that destracts students from class ,it also needs to verify who the teacher is so if the teacher is sharing he r screen she needs to give permission to a student before they write on the screen and the app needs to make sure that no one can come in without their full names. I hope this thing can be put in place .	44
ABHISHEK .M	2021-05-22	3	Plz improve background effects in zoom mobile and also solve connecting issues	0
D R	2021-01-25	2	At times challenging to use for myself and other guests - following instructions which don't always show as what appears on your screen. Most frustrating is I now get spam from other organizations who solicit me to join their meetings doing this through my Zoom linked Google Calendar. Following instructions to unlink my GC says to use links that do not show in my zoom web portal ie. User Management link or Account Management. Should not be so complicated for the average user. I uninstalled app.	63

Garvita Chaudhary	2021-05-28	4	This app is awesome . the main reason for giving it only 4 stars is that it should have some cool filters.So I just want to request you to please add some filters on this app.Please.	1
Cavell Lindsay	2021-03-01	4	Great app and service. Much appreciated especially during this pandemic. I have one suggestion...on mobile devices if you could make it possible for you to mute/unmute yourself and mute others from the Participants screen instead of always having to switch back to the main screen that would be greatly appreciated.	45
MyArt Law	2021-04-21	3	With the updates, the blue hands went away. Please bring the blue hands back!!! The other hands get lost in the background of people's frames/homes.	1

Anjana Das	2021-02-20	5	Very best app for online studies but there is a trouble that the outsiders come easily in the meeting and disturb all the students which causes a great disturbance in the minds and concentration of students. There should be a feature of writing a list of students and the app will automatically accept them to enter and those whose name is not in the list they will be put into the waiting room then the host will decide whether to join or reject them . This feature will be very very useful for us .	47
Renee Wendy	2021-01-31	3	FRUSTRATING: Audio vanishes (1) when shifting between Zoom screens to see participants, (2) when in another app for note taking etc, (3) when turn off screen to save battery life and still want to hear the meeting. Accidental screen touch = dramatic nuisance! Turning on the drawing feature, turning on/off video or sound unexpectedly, particularly while driving the overly responsive screen is painful. Would be great to hear the meeting with screen turned off, like YouTube premium.	521
Gunjan Srivastava	2021-06-01	2	Good but some time network issue	0
Matthias Oversluizen	2021-02-07	2	Sound of screen sharing is not working when outside of the application. Sound from other microphones is still working when outside of the application. Very confusing, please fix this. Using it now to monitor the sound in our church. Issue only occurs on phones. Also ability to listen in stereo on phones is not available and Bluetooth sound is not the same(bad quality) as via laptop (using galaxy buds +).	172

Ambili glenson	2021-02-20	4	"This is a pretty good app for classess and meeting with friends.....i would actually wish that it could like have an option to change the name of the user in the zoom contacts and put the name of our choice......for example:my best friend name is Jenna i should have the option to rename her into ""my bff"" so that, this name can be only be visible to me and it doesnt change for others....i hope u see this....Thanks!"	1078
Bernard Brincat	2021-02-20	1	Very frustrating to receive an audio attachment in a chat and, despite being able to listen to it, am unable to save, download or use it in another app. Zoom downloads it but it never appears in the file system. You do not have full access to it. A very outdated approach to mobile apps. What garbage.	939

MAISHA TASNIA	2021-01-15	5	There are some features may be changeable. The ato screen rotate is disturbing. The sound and video options on-off system may want a double click or safe touch button for security. Other problem is when the host turns on the video and speaks or writes on boards without screen share, his video goes on-off without his control and when someone speaks without video on, his profile picture comes in front and disturbs. I hope you solve my problems. And thanks for the amplified meeting range....	1286

Val Havard	2021-04-02	5	Zoom is Great for our family quizzes when there are 4 devices apart from mine. I miss out with larger gatherings as I can only see up to 4 devices on my tablet's screen, I then decide to see the speaker view. Zoom is Far better than another meeting app I used as you can choose the speaker view, and it's very easy to adjust settings if you want to join without audio or video. Everything is straightforward. I just wish I could opt to see chat information on the screen without losing the picture.	495
Grace Obetta	2021-04-18	4	The app is good. You can join a meet or host meeting easily but the problem I had was that my voice cannot be heard no matter how I raise my voice. I was in a meeting but dumb because I cannot be heard at all.	5
Datta Sai bhargav Panguluri	2021-04-09	1	Not only uploading files, this app doesn't even show files uploaded from pc in a meeting. Also this app always starts as potrait mode I would like to have more features for tablet. Also there could be a picture in picture feature like pc. Also, when we save the pictures which are shared in meeting in album, some of them are good but others just show a blank screen and the picture is not saved.	113
Lunar Delusions	2021-03-12	1	This program is the biggest piece of junk I have ever used. I was unable to do an interview because your sound refuses to enable. 4 separate times I reconnected, restarted my phone, checked the volume IN the program as well as on my phone. I know my sound works because it's making sound as I angrily type this message. This program is garbage.	160
Vandana Sahu	2021-02-11	2	1.The network connection is good but it's showing the network is poor. 2. I have signed in but today it's showing to sign in again . 3.

And it causes so much data. 4.I can't change my screen name it's showing unable to change screen name so how can I put my correct name	10
patricia thakur	2021-02-05	4	Great for calls. Would be 5 stars of I could click on a meeting number in outlook and have launch the app and join the meeting. Instead I have to copy the meeting number and password from my calendar app then navigate to my clipboard to paste them in the zoom app. I don't think these steps are necessary for iPhone, only Android. Webex doea this and it is the only thing keeping me from using zoom full time and from giving the app 5 stars.	782
Hanz Chyou	2021-02-09	2	Some features are less accessible during a video call. For example, chat, I think it needs faster access to here. Many things I want to convey in the forum, but without having to interrupt ongoing conversations. The video display is also not neat. The different screen resolutions are not good to look at.	76

Peter	2021-02-05	2	The virtual background can only set for the higher version of smartphone, please fix it so that some of the lower version can use the virtual background too. And for the meeting, once we are inside the meeting, we can't play other apps or video that contain sound using bluetooth headset, because it will disconnect the earphone and turn into speaker's phone automatically, please fix this app!!!	142

Kate Marin	2021-04-08	4	Amazing to interact at such distance. Controls not particularly intuitive (mic, views of others, chat), w resulting frequent hunts for controls & content screen. Prefer a controls option on all screens, visible/not visible by my choice. Also want to be able to choose which screen is always visible, & which/ how many others are next to the always-on screen. Switching to find the current speaker, back to content, etc. really infringes on natural interchange. Glad Zoom exists, tho!	1878

kareden morgan	2021-03-30	2	The Zoom experience is really hobbled with Android and Chrome OS. It's harder to manage meetings because the functionality that's part of iOS and MAC isn't part of Android and Chrome OS. I can't even use a virtual or blurred background -- they're unavailable. So if I need to have a zoom meeting, I use my iPad. I never use my Android phone or my chromebook. It's just too frustrating.	354

Hemalatha Kumar	2021-04-07	5	Excellent. Online teaching through zoom is awesome experience. I had a great time using this app since a year and have taken online classes to the next level (interactive mode). Explored all the features like share screen, video filters, mute on entry, disable waiting room, video background, chime on entry exit, spotlight, pin video, polling, participants list, chat, downloads. The best feature is breakout room for conducting group activities. Highly recommend this app for all. Hemalatha Kumar	1220

Umakanta Rath	2021-01-13	1	The app always freezes still if I have high speed internet, the whole screen gets black and no one's voice is audible, first when I was using this app it was working perfectly but after the new update it always freezes and sometimes even if I my video is on in the participant list it shows that my video is off. Please fix this problem as quickly as possible.	778
Madison Erickson	2021-02-07	1	This app is so incredibly broken, there's no volume control and if my bluetooth earbuds die, it automatically starts playing everyone's voices out of my speakers at FULL VOLUME and there's no mute option. This is such a terrible app and it's such a disruption to the world. It's ridiculous that you can't give us the simple ability to lower/mute the volume when we need to.	109

Shakib Ahmed	2021-02-22	1	It's quite outrageous that this company wouldn't increase their customer support service in response to the increase in subscribers. People who are PAID subscribers are NOT allowed access to their live customer support unless they're part of a corporate subscription. I needed to use zoom for a large wedding which included paying extra for more participants however, couldn't get it to work correctly because of an error. Ended up not being able to use it at all.	64
ÁøªË®≥ËÄÖMaru	2021-03-16	1	The new update on March 1st breaks support for bluetooth audio. Trying to reconnect requires you to exit the aoo and rejoin the meeting. Sometimes puts you in an endless loop of trying to connect it to call audio which keeps it limbo trying to connect between phone and bluetooth audio, you will either hear 0.5 second bits or nothing at all. The issue also extends to using bluetooth audio devices while using this app, it will not somehow disable all audio from reaching the bluetooth device.	97
Derek Overhauser	2021-01-14	1	Normally I would give Zoom a 5 star rating but for the last month or so it has been having Audio issues like someone is turn down and up and off and on the audio, I keep checking my computer volume setting and it seems fine. Emailed Zoom about the issue and NO RESPONCE but, I sure did start getting their spam. This sure is a great issue to have in court meetings and recovery meetings.	180

PLEASE. Fix this issue	813

Gerry Vickers	2021-01-16	1	Awful.

I insist on Google meet, which works fine.	186
Jeffery Beaudry	2021-03-02	5	Chat Box and Whiteboard are very powerful for tutoring and classroom instruction. Kids enjoy the Emojis. Quality of audio and video usually high except for occasional outages. As a music teacher, I find the Enable Original Sound feature very powerful, allowing one to hear higher and lower frequencies as well as the more average frequencies most common in vocal conversation.	73
Shashwat Jain	2021-01-25	1	Sorry for this 1 star but everyday it comes up with some problem during the meeting. I even reinstalled it only to see no changes.

Alex Kwake	2021-02-14	3	It's not bad, but lacks functionality compared to desktop version. In particular, none of the filters seem available. Also frustrated that camera reorients to landscape, but chat doesn't. So, if you want to read chat you have to turn your phone and then turn it back when you are done.	3
Aaron Blakey	2021-04-08	5	Excellent service. Very well streamlined! Good for most all nonessential meetings, and even some very important ones, like getting together with friends or even family occasionally. Not the best for high security I imagine, but for light stuff its fine for probebly. Like Most Social and church or loose business data. Very smooth provided you have adequate internet response.	75
XI-C-45 Heramb Vengurlekar	2021-05-04	1	The experience is awful as it requires an update everytime a new version comes and it becomes obligatory to update the app because you cannot join any meeting if you haven't updated the app	0

Najaah M	2021-01-21	2	Ever since the update, my camera does not show, but instead it displays a black screen for me. I had to uninstall the app, then re-install and it finally worked. However, when I come out of zoom then enter it again, I appear as a black screen AGAIN. I cant keep uninstalling and reinstalling! Ridiculous.	26
ATrueLilac	2021-01-23	3	Now zoom is a really good app for the time we are in right now. But bugs need to be fixed. Now I'm in PGCPS which requires you to verify that your a student there to join meetings with a teacher or staff from there. When I put the meeting ID it brings me to the zoom website where I verify myself but once I do the verification I can't launch the meeting on the app and there becomes a Neverending loop of failure. Please fix this bug so I can join my classes with ease.	16

Ajit Prajapati	2021-02-18	1	My review got deleted. This app needs improvement. It consumes too much data and battery on mobile, it is not compatible with Bluetooth devices. While using this application on laptop my bluetooth headphone works perfectly after downloading add-on for suppressing background noise which is not available for mobile. Using this app on mobile is not recommended.	165

They cant let me explain, same goes for my classmates. Can't you at least put something on their screen and they could see ""slow connection"". I've been suffering from this for 2 semesters."	67

Jay Dreamer	2021-03-01	1	Had issues on multiple occassions. Having to re-sign in time after time, audio cuts out, video cuts out, deleting app and reinstalling. Not sure why its just zoom that I have issues with. For context, my cache is cleared prior to every zoom meeting, my internet is fantastic and have had no issues with other video calls on other platforms.	44
Catherine B	2021-02-09	1	worst app, it's always took too long to load when i join a specific meeting and the app keeps on crashing when i tilt my phone, it should have a option if we want to rotate the screen. The video is inverted that's why it so hard to understand some words. Zoom should have its own loading site when clicking links and lots more.. Bad experience with this app.	148
Carlos G	2021-04-25	5	It is appropiate for any situation. It really made a different in Education in times of covid.	0
Angela Fields	2021-01-14	4	I have not yet used all of the features the app offers because I simply did not know they were available or I did not know how. I have been using the app for nearly 12 months now for medical appointments and other meetings. I am impressed with how little memory and space it uses on my phone. I do not have any experience with similar apps though so I cannot offer a comparison.	89
P. K.	2021-02-26	2	For some lectures, Even though I have a very strong high speed internet connection, I'm not able to connect to Meeting. Also, if get connected then, suddenly I get disconnected in between my online lectures... Please zoom improve your app, I've missed 6 lectures so far because of you! The interface of the app is very boring, laggy, and hard to operate kinda...I always get bored looking at the screen where as Microsoft team and Google meet are very good and refreshing interface having apps.	78
Jonathan Hernandez	2021-03-01	1	"An insult to modern day webcam technology. The way to turn on audio is overcomplicated and redundant. Instead of just clicking a button that turns audio on, this garbage app forces you to ""call in"" to the meeting using your phones call service or other complicated use of it. Whoover thought this was a good idea needs to be working at mcdonalds as they have no use in technological work fields."	15
Dibyak Ghosh	2021-02-06	4	This app is overall awesome. But there is few problems that it must be updated in a way that the video must not be off whrn the screen is minimized when required. Another thing is that it must be allowed to share sound during screen share in Android system. Also there must be positive as well as negative reactions.	870
Christina Simula	2021-01-28	5	I had a problem in the beginning trying to figure out how to use the zoom app. However (I'm still learning how to use zoom) I find this app extremely helpful, it has definitely made my life easier! Instead of missing time from work, family & friends I just hop on zoom in the comfort of my own home or whatever I may be at the moment not having to take the extra time to travel to & from a meeting! The more I use zoom, the more I appreciate the freedom this app provides!!	49
Paul Sparkone	2021-03-04	3	Vastly superior audio quality compared with WhatsApp, but... Heavy on data usage and battery drain. Also picks up background noise and converts it to audio distortion on call (probably fair to call that user error for being in a noisy environment during calls). Am generally very happy with Zoom so far. Each time WhatsApp messes around, it is Zoom that I first turn to.	40
umesh choudhary	2021-05-01	3	I have given 3 stars out of 5 because it consume a very high rate network I have 3 classes of 1 hour each and after the class the whole network is used by 100% so i request you to please do. Something of net consume but otherwise this app is good for meeting	0

DEVs you should fix this and this problem is the reason for three stars rating... Hope you'll fix this problem as early as possible...	107

Anthony J	2021-03-06	1	3/5 have multiple problems with this app, the windows app, the ios app, doesn't matter, the licensing thing stupid, you can't have an alternate host open a meeting in an emergency if you can't make it without all these pre-configured steps, which is really stupid. Also I had setup a meeting to make sure everything was right I got the alternate host to start the meeting which worked , then I ha it setup for members to auto join the session, that didn't work I spent $300/yr on this not worth it!	142

Derek Mecham	2021-03-07	1	This app would not accept the meeting ID when calling in, let alone the passcode and did not give a second chance. As connecting to a meeting is the sole purpose for the mobile app, this 1-star rating reflects how poorly this app performed its intended function after multiple attempts. The desktop version with phone call-in worked as expected.	115

Michael Winkler	2021-02-08	3	"Thanks for enabeling ""original sound"" on the android version as well, but for teaching music online this is not enough yet.

Gbe Nother	2021-02-18	5	Easy to use as a receiver, but too complicated to set up as a sender, at least to my techno-challenged brain. Works well technically, is relatively glitch free, and (for now at least), unencumbered by advertising. Could this set of features be translated to crypto? I mean, use end to end encryption to ensure privacy?	27

Just had a SHEER WASTE OF TIME & MONEY!!! Before downloading I was a bit skeptical upon reading the reviews! Again being optimistic took it to be a network issue at the users end.However, it seems the reviews are not completely baseless... however wasn't able to appeal to the Company/team's to earnestly resolve the Issues pointed.	111

That's why 3 starts else deserves much better	50
DB COOPER	2021-03-24	5	Pretty good. Mostly works as expected, usually clicking on invitation links is all it takes to join meetings. Occasionally (on my phone) can't tell whether the video and sound are on or off, losing 1 star. But it IS free, ad-free, and works. Better even than many pay of it's to use competitors. Which takes it back to 5 stars. üëçüèΩüòé	109

As a video chat app, I am highly disappointed. I've reached out to the app developer who refuses to attempt to fix this problem. Would highly NOT recommend.	87

Carla Bain	2021-03-20	4	Love having zoom appreciate being able to talk to family and friends during pandemic. Keeps everyone safe, can still attend weddings, religious events. Wish time limit a bit longer, had one complication during wedding, bride paid for 300 guests, but still blocked joining at 100. Very upsetting and challenging to fix. Need to remedy that.	16
Madhuri Mudiraj	2021-04-17	4	I want zoom to add some features which helps students not to miss any class As soon as link of meeting comes i want zoom to save the timings and give notification that class has been started so that students can be benefitted	1
Syed Khaleel	2021-06-25	3	ZOOM please Provide 2x speed in zoom recorded meetings. It will surely benefit you	0
Bouke Bergsma	2021-02-21	1	I've been trying to help my mom get on Zoom. All she knows to do with a phone is hold it to her head. She cannot work with a phone while looking at it, at least not while calling. Let alone she use a bluetooth headset. It just won't work. But ZOOM for Android is so atrociously bad... You CANNOT set it to use the bottom mic and give normal phone-like audio out, so you can use it like a phone to do an audio-only phone-like call. You CANNOT get it off full blast speakerphone and give normal audio out. You CANNOT disable the mode where at the slightest touch you go into the save driving mode even though you're not in a freaking car. It is bad. It is really really really bad. It is so frustrating because it is so much better on Windows. Well, obviously not even close to Skype or Teams, but at least it has breakout rooms and easy mic/speaker device selection. Why is there no mic/speaker device selection on Android? WHY? And why am I pretty much the only one missing this? Being able to use it like you use a normal phone makes so much sense for audio-only calls. This is a really weird thing to get THIS wrong. It's ridiculous that a platform THIS world-class gives android users THIS bad an experience. What if I want to walk down the street while on a call and I don't have a headset. Do I really need to keep the phone in front of my head like an idiot the whole time? Sorry for the rant but this is totally frustrating. It's like on Android they dumbed it down to a toddler teleconference device. It's driving me crazy.	48

Ann deSouza Kennedy	2021-04-13	5	I use Zoom twice a week for meetings. It is clear and easy to log into if you get the Zoom number and pass word ahead of time.	1
Amy Vehill	2021-04-02	1	I'd give it zero stars if I could comment.... so I have one to share my experience. So far this app doesn't work at all for me. Who I'm meeting with (once on a monthly basis) can't ever hear or see me without a bunch of... whatever. I think the set up instructions are missing something important. I've uninstalled and reinstalled 3x already. Still have problems.	1319

Indian boy	2021-04-13	5	ZOOM is best meeting and online video call, online class and excellent service, best video quality and audio experience but my problem is it takes bit of space which fulfill's the storage.	1
Priyanka	2021-03-25	2	Even after watching that a lot many people had replied as what I too want to say, but I saw that there's no improvement. The very most major problem suffered by me or I thing by everyone while using the application is that the network connection is allset but still the zoom meeting closes the meeting/class. I want that all the reviews should be 5 starred but that could only be possible if the editors do.	805
Manoj Kumar M	2021-04-29	1	In update they say virtual background came for android but it is not working on my mobile phone of version android 10 Many bugs are there Sometimes even when password is right we cannot login	0
Lal Sahab Singh	2021-04-06	2	I am facing a lot of trouble with this app. Every time I join the meeting I am not able to stay in in the meeting for more than 5 minutes even my internet connection strength is excellent. Rest of the things are good. Please fix this problem as soon possible bcz I am a student and I was attending my online classes when this all happened.	382

Divij Pewa	2021-02-18	3	Vey nice but its hard to learn today or tomorrow . I learnt very thing and very difficult for kids now in the pandemic meet is easier to use as compared Video quality is not good sound quality is 50 to 80 percent nice but still need some improvement. U can even make zoom the best app in the world üåé nearly 500 million insane üò≥ but the thing is quality both sound and video quality need some improvements then the app is the best app.	49
Prudence Julius	2021-04-19	5	I enjoy it, helps to connect people where ever you are in the world. Very nice and helpful. Just that network disturbs sometimes.üëç	5
Luqman Dogar	2021-05-29	5	I love this app but today it's not working I don't know why	0
Aryan Srivastava	2021-02-19	1	There should be an option to search within the videos of different participants. PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE TO GET 5 STARS. PLEASE ADD IT....... Review readers, I would suggest Google meet. The don't listen to our reviews. Are you reading, your ratings are getting down. Why you people are not doing anything????? Seriously, cannot be called the cream of online meeting apps and webinars!!!!	32
Gwen Phillips	2021-04-13	5	I have found that zoom has been great for me after I learned some of the basics. I am still learning how to operate it but I am able to communicate.	3
Rynae Lockwood	2021-03-04	1	It's so bad, if i could give it zero stars I would. on MANY Eacations it has buged out as in someone was to quiet becase the mics are always like that and when I put my headphones on the mics decide to go full on blast mod were I can barely hear any one because my eardrums are blasted out. I DON'T think you should get this app, but I haven't done it on my phone yet. Maybe it is better on your phone??? Idk but if you have it on your computer, I'll prey that your eardrums aren't blasted out yet.	149
Carol Morris	2021-01-17	4	I've used this app to talk with high school friends during the COVID-19 shutdown. I like it because we have one friend that lives across the country, so we have a chance to physically see how he's doing. Since my previous review I've been on Zoom twice on Thanksgiving with friends and family. And another to celebrate a family members 80th birthday on January 15th. So I'm definitely enjoying Zoom. It makes being single during a pandemic much more bearable.	81
Action studios Studios	2021-04-15	1	On Android unable to see meeting details, recurring section is useless as it does not have any details. Not an enterprise app anyways where basics are not even met.	8
Learn cooking with RK	2021-06-15	3	Zoom takes a lot of battery and my device heats up	0
Duncan Mellor	2021-03-13	3	Good but when in a meeting with 5 people you only get 4 tiles per screen yet your own tile is always tile number 1 you have to manually change screens to see number 5. Let your tile be moved or set it as the last tile. Seeing myself but not a friend is very frustrating. I would not recommend this app for anything other than presentations where seeing the other participants is not needed.	61
Gemma Wilson	2021-03-25	5	Amazing. So pleased to have this on my phone. Being able to access meetings so easily has been a miraculous thing during lockdown especially. The app is extremely easy to use, meaning it can be used by old and young alike. Never had an issue. Really glad that this platform exists.	84
Shubham Zete	2021-05-25	5	This app is wonderful it is best for online meeting	0
Regina Gooden	2021-02-14	3	Luv it!!! It's a lifesaver in this Pandemic!!‚ò∫üëçüå∫ But...That tiny-winy screen is bothersome when on with just 1 person. I liked it muuuuch better b4 this updated screen alteration, where the visuals were side-by-side. It's ergonomically painful to keep your head down for hours in meetings with one person looking down into the right corner where their passport-sized picture of them is. Make me walk away wth a neck-ache! üò• Otherwise It gets a 5 star!! Because I luv the Ingenuity of ZOOM!!üòäüå∫üëç	54

Abhishek Goudcharla	2021-02-23	1	The mic and video should be provided in the slot where chat and raise hand options are given. Most of the time we hold devices in our hand ,if anything touches the sceen where these options are provided ,it is going to be a huge mess while in a meeting. The mic doesnot disable itself hen speaking a call ,it will capture the sound.	32
Progressive Discussions	2021-04-03	3	My only problem with zoom and it is a big one is that every time I join a zoom meeting the volume in my Android phone is instantly lowered to the bare minimum, even though all my volume controls are up to the maximum. Plus all of my Bluetooth devices are turned off. Zoom should add the feature of live streaming and recording meetings.	97

David Dunn	2021-04-15	2	Desktop app is fine, but this app is only just passable. It has choppy video, audio delays for 3s or more, burns through battery faster than anything else and makes the phone uncomfortably hot. It works, but there's room for improvement on every front.	5

Jack Fewx	2021-03-19	2	Pretty obvious the app gets a fraction of the attention as the PC version. Bluetooth handling is a steaming pile of .... If at anytime during a call the bluetooth loses connection or changes (like connecting to the car!), ALL bluetooth is disabled and the only way to get it back is leave the call and rejoin. What a pain!	44

Lionel Gettliffe-Rudling	2021-02-08	4	Video quality is generally good. Interface is quirky. Settings split between App and Website with no obvious logic. Schedular only inegrates with calendars if you set the meeting Invite links cannot be imported. Audio does not handle multiple sound sources so no background sound bedding possible. Cannot control individual external sound sources, so you are at the mercy of the other participants' volume settings. The reaction emoji are a limited set instead of the whole or custom set like Discord	404

I am so grateful for this type of technology as it has helped me to keep to a routine. Thank you zoom!!	59

Kofi Asiedu-Berchie	2021-01-25	3	Zoom set a trend for many meeting apps butbis missing a key feature. Users also join meetings and they are scheduled in advance. Zoom has no way to manually add a future event not hosted by the user. If this feature could be added so you can add a meeting you want to join in the future and not via email invitation, it cuts out at least 2 minutes of time, where the user doesnt have to add to their calendar.	14

I was just hoping that when we do zoom on my new device I could use virtual background, I could use filter. Please answer zoom, please fix this, I couldn't stand this.	596

Fayth's Film	2021-03-24	4	I wish you could change the chat box positions same as the computer . Its wasting time to go in to chat box and type. If you're worried of word size make it able to be changed in settings. Putting the chat box side by side is easier for people to type and also look at the shared screen. And also maybe you can let people change their settings for chatbox positions . And also pls make the app for peole receive amd send pdf img in the chat box. Thanks. Lets make zoom better.	25

Christine Phillips	2021-02-01	2	All the money Zoom is making it can be much better than what it is. For instance trimming/editing a video feature on zoom itself. It shouldn't take so much to download the video and edit it. When I download and edit it on my device the video goes back to the original time. Hopefully they can update zoom soon.	116

Bala Murugan	2021-04-12	3	Why this app is not providing Bluetooth speaker connecting option? If a couple of people want to listen lecture audio through speaker it might be more useful from this app. So Kindly consider this issue.other than that the app is superb	1

Sia Kripalani	2021-02-23	2	I wish I could give this a higher rating, but honestly, the iOS version of zoom is much better. On a chromebook, it is missing a lot of the features, we can't see the participants while screensharing, and we are unable to do the reactions. I wish it had all of these features.	18

Can't hear the others, can't speak - on EITHER one of my devices, one of them being a brand-new Pixel 4a, the other one a brand-new Samsung SM-T970. FRUSTRATING to have everyone wait for you to figure out what's wrong and have them think you're some tech-inept idiot who doesn't know where the mike button is. No global settings available ANYWHERE, only for the meeting. Had to go through browser to use it at all, with VERY limited functionality!	61

When I was gonna join a meeting it said the code was incorrect so I redownload zoom and it was also incorrect I also checked if any one else's zoom was working and they said yes 2.)

Bradley Jolley Sr.	2021-03-04	3	It's a bit difficult to have a normal conversation like you would have when in a room together. When more than one person talks at the same time, you can't hear everyone like you could if you were all together. But it is a convenient app to have for those who can not meet in person. Especially during the pandemic. It would be helpful if you could hear a slight sound when people are raising their hand or sending a text chat.	75

Shashank Mandavkar	2021-03-11	1	I would have been not given this app a single star but for rating I did it . It consumes a lot of data and battery of your phone. There are many connectivity issues . I will refer you to use google meets and Microsoft teams rather than this . If the company solves all the issues I will increase my rating .	140
Saritza Guadalupe	2021-01-27	1	DUDE, People using this app will regret downloading it. It does auto-rotating when my device is on vertical mode, this has virtual background but if you put it on it not only in mirror mode but it switches to a mode u dont like, When i don't have any internet problems my class says i have an echo, and i also hear everyone with echo, In my opinion its garbage. And it includes bugs, so fix it. or this APP IS GARBAGE.	36
S KISHORE BE MECHANICAL	2021-06-02	1	Zoom please respond me.

Sayaka_ Rouzuko	2021-03-23	4	"The app is so good and I recommend it! But my only issues is about the screen sharing.. it glitches alot when me and my friends tried to watch a movie.. the sexonce thing is about the ""hand raising"" its supposed to pop up to the teachers/person screen so they can realise that your trying to talk.... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èotherwise I dont have problems with this app!

Wolf Gaming Zone	2021-02-08	5	This is best cloud meeting I ever seen it, but an issue we are facing that :- In older version of zoom when I going to participants list or in other apps like WhatsApp our video is on , but after several updates of this app, now when I going to participants list our video is stopped and even when we are using other app our video is still off. Please fix that issue then I will be give 5 stars . But otherwise the app is nice for doing meeting The issue is solved thanks	46

sushma agrawal	2021-01-15	5	This app is superb for virtual meetings.... It has all the features that a meeting app should have .... I prefer everyone to use it... But a good thing always have a bad side... And in this when your meeting is started and you start another app your video get turned off... As a student i have to keep my video on while the class is going on... So this makes me irritated manier times... But this app is superb... Wow ü§©ü§©ü§©	70
Syeda Tazeen Fatima	2021-04-03	4	It's a great app but the reason why I gave it four star is that when I used to open my video in the meeting it shows off in the participants area. I think you guys should improve this thing. Other than this it's a pretty good app.	1
Ana Hartley	2021-05-01	1	Where is the feature in settings of zoom to change bandwidth to a smaller one so you don't use so much data. It SHOULD b available, and all sites showing how zoom works, say how to use this...	0
K S	2021-02-28	1	ZOOM is listed as a Samsung DeX enhanced app. So, while in Samsung DeX mode, please, add these necessary features to ZOOM: 1. Enable ability to select sound through the monitor via the connected HDMI adapter; 2. View more than 4 people in the Gallery View on the larger monitor DeX screen; 3. Enable ability to include sound along with Screen Share; 4. Allow to rotate camera video to either landscape or portrait. Thank You!	288

Kusum Das	2021-02-04	5	A very nice app for teachers and students also. I mean teachers can do their classes and students can also talk with their friends in zoom.As in video callings we can chat only with 6 or 7 friends but in zoom we can chat with more than 50 friends so zoom is the best choice of mine for chatting with my friends.If possible then make more features on zoom. But only sometimes I am unable to join & sometimes I am not able to on my video so i have to rejoin but still give i'll 5‚≠ê.It's best app for me.	66

Bhumika Bansal	2021-04-11	2	The new version of zoom is creating very much problem mainly of voice breaking. The update version does not work perfectly as compare to the old version.	3
Brad Johnson	2021-03-07	2	Using the app on my phone with a Bluetooth headset, zoom puts sound through the ear buds, but will not use the headset microphone, only the microphone in the phone itself.

Mark Lillis	2021-03-24	3	Zoom does poorly with casting: only the video will cast on Google so I have to use Bluetooth for audio. When I not near a TV, if I only try to use Bluetooth to my Onkyo receiver, that just drives quieter phone audio without actually going to the BT device. UGH! Other apps behave correctly with audio, so this is a Zoom issue.	14
007 SCI XII A Kaneez Ayesha	2021-03-03	1	This is the worst app. This app works fine for 2-3 days. Then suddenly says there is a network issue.It just says connecting, and never connects.

Curtis Flurry	2021-03-01	5	Zoom has been very useful to me especially during this difficult time of the Covid-19 Pandemic.

random ally	2021-04-09	1	Tons of glitches, unexplained errors and the fcat that millions are being forced to use it. If you need a video call service, just use Google meets, sure you need an account, but at least you can have meetings that you don't have to worry about running out of time on.	40

S.M. Horne	2021-03-30	3	UPDATE: Did latest update remove Use Original Sound? W/O it Zoom won't send to bluetooth at all & STILL won't Cast! These options work all the time with all my other apps. This happens w/Zoom on computer, phone, & tablet. Where's Background on Android? Zoom is handy, free, easy to learn. Audio & video breaking up happens & no one knows why.	87

Shawna Ryan	2021-01-27	4	This app has become indispensable during this pandemic. It works excellently, the streaming is very good even on my unsuperior phone. the only thing that would be better is if you could see everybody at once on the phone instead of having to switch back and forth sometimes.	40
Morgane Bozet	2021-02-03	2	Used to work very well. Now it just won't open at all on my android tablet. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, still not working. Entering the meeting ID and password directly into the app also somehow doesn't work. Is there an email address where I can contact the tech support ? I'm not finding the information online. Please help.	19
Shubham Manandhar	2021-03-27	5	It is the best online meeting app but I have a concern! Before I started using zoom, my camera would work fine but after I used it for 5,6 times my camera stoped working. Now it is working fine. Another concern is that an indian boy comes in our class with my classmates name and he writes bad words in chat and when he opens his mike and speeks he says that our clas teacher is bad. One of the zoom staffs had come in our class and she said that she had come to see if the class is working fine.	59
Praveen Santosh	2021-02-14	5	Great app for personal or group video conferencing, the best one I ever came up till now. Keep it up. But there's one thing lacking, video sharing option for mobile devices, if that comes to zoom it will be the best video conferencing application ever.	47
Mstammanna29 Tammana	2021-04-12	1	I had the worst experience with zoom if I have press any key it will automatically it will either unmute me or on my camera. I did not even enable shortcut keys to unmute or on my cam but it's still unmuting and starting my cam pls fix this bug	5

Margaret Burke	2021-02-14	4	I really do enjoy this app I've used it on the phone & used it on the Laptop. Once you use it for the time it's really easy to use & understand it but I does take that first time to really find out about it. Other than that it's well worth using & one of the best for video calling more than one person.	39

Syed Rehman Bukhari	2021-02-24	5	It's been more empowering experience with zoom through the ways world shifted digitally in all the aspects of life especially it profoundly influenced the student's career with much supportive hands, in addition if some features like saving and uploading of videos within zoom application to access them later on when one get offline, if they are incorporated within zoom it would be more seductive and compatible application in the world.	10

Charles Simekha	2021-03-31	1	Payments & plans are deceptive zoom is only after your money.I had a pending payment for monthly subscription,zoom offered an upgrade and i paid for yearly subscription.to my surprise i recived an email detailing that my account will be suspended due to non payment,i had already paid for yearly Subscription. they further deducted the monthly charge i felt both cheated & decieved. Why cant u simply backdate my subscription.let licenced customers know their upgrade eligibility	23
Oliver Balfour	2021-03-30	2	It works, just. Bluetooth headphones don't work half the time. Sometimes I get randomly unmuted. When you connect it starts with the mike and cam automatically on, which is never desirable. I'm very lucky not to have been in an embarrassing situation yet.	65

stanley john	2021-02-06	3	Good app but please bring back the feature where leaving your zoom during a meeting or clicking on participants during a meeting will still be showing a captured image of you to other participants before leaving the screen instead of it completely turing off your camera till you return to the meeting, you could make it optional...that is participants having the ability to turn this feature on or off	6

2005-Ayushmaan Karmokar	2021-02-23	1	Would prefer is the screen rotation stops working, when rotation is turned off in the system settings, or atleast give an option to turn it off, becomes very difficult to follow through meetings, when you want it in potrait mode, but it's landscape mode, because the phone thinks your hands are slightly tilted.	15
Rudy Torres	2021-01-21	3	So far so good, the only thing that I have found to take away from it being a 5 star ratings is that it was difficult to get the app started after it was downloaded to my android Samsung Galaxy a10e5800.:‚Ä¢{ After further use all I am very pleased it does everything that's needed and more!Thank you so very much for your apps.outstanding performance , I can see,talk text my loved ones at the meetings and fellowship.

Ronda Bernstein	2021-03-05	3	"It's been a year & still no Zoom Background option. Don't understand why I can't mute the audio. Have to always have headphones nearby to put in plug if someone is speaking to me IRL. Please stop ignoring my device rotation setting. Need ""Use Wifi Only"" setting like other streaming services. Also you show a tablet view in your example photos yet Play Store says app isn't optimized for my device, which is a tablet. For ex, chat needs to show on side, not full screen. Same w/participant list."	16

Royd M	2021-02-01	1	Audio channel problems. Especially with bluetooth. Somehow, this app affects the entire phone and no other app can produce sound effectively if they are connected to this app. It messes the audio of the phone.

Secre Swallowtail	2021-02-18	2	Wasted a day on my online class because of the join audio function. There not even a tutorial that you need to do that, had to browse on the internet to figure it out.

The video does not work on her phone, so she had to try it on my phone. When she tried it on my phone, it worked. Please improve	103
Shanita Nelson	2021-03-24	5	Someone and for me a little information about zoom and I was so glad that they did it helps you to maintain certain things in your Google calendar your meetings (virtual) it's a great resource at 2 to have working with your co-workers able to see them and to review certain documents when giving a presentation is staying connected with your social life especially doing covid-19 able to zoom in with your friends or loved one multiple and have a social Gathering as if you're sitting in person	28

So I'm not sure I'll give 3 stars or 4, but I'm giving for 4 Cuz I love creating zoom meetings. Even I did.

M2jTopTech Group MG	2021-06-11	5	I love this app so much. The video is superb and works well even with slow network	0
Didier A.	2021-03-08	1	Not a very good app, barely any feature, doesn't even have a gallery view that can scale down and fit everyone on your phone, instead you have to scroll through pages to see more. No way to send each other pictures or videos, chat is very limited in functionality.	9

ABHIK DE	2021-01-14	4	Video quality, audio quality, & all the exciting features of zoom is very good, but there is a problem with recording of the meeting. One who is accessing the zoom by pc or laptop can record the meeting by the permission of the host,but the another one who is accessing zoom by a smart phone can't record the meeting by the permission of the host. Please solve this problem.We have to record our important meetings.	35

Pam Wilson	2021-03-13	3	I'm going to 4 regular Zoom meetings which are usually smooth but the last two have been poor. Audio today but no picture of me showing. When Zoom is good it's excellent but about 1 in 3 of the regular 3-4 a week I attend have been poor with screen freezing, no vision and/or video, total loss requiring me to leave the meeting and rejoin which sometimes works but sometimes fails. It's not my device or connection as is regularly happens to other participants too on different devices.	40
Last Raven	2021-04-01	4	I often miss the texts I get during a meeting. It would be helpful if this app got a feature like when you get notifications in the chat during a meeting, you'll get a sound notif. And you can turn off the sound option if you want. This aside, the app works fine.	104

Archit Dhone	2021-02-02	2	Once upon a time it was all going well until the last update. You cannot see the elasped the time. The interface is very odd now(not odd but since its new we are forced to get adjusted to it). Hope the developers on their next update bring back the earlier UI.	11

Also please make it more mouse friendly by making the control bar with microphone and video settings when hovering a mouse pointer over the app.	17

Bob Yeoh	2021-03-16	1	Always poor connection, keep on buffering on audio and video. Very frustrating to use when having important meetings! Imagine you are having and important call with your boss or clients and you keep getting disconnected. I would not recommend zoom to others.	17
Sudipta Das	2021-01-31	3	It has been great operating zoom now for the past 7-8 months. Sometimes, though, in a video meeting, when more than two people are speaking at the same time, there is a problem in the clarity of sound ie the sound becomes cracked. It would be nicer if this problem could be solved.	9
ravinder kumar	2021-04-28	3	This app is good but sometimes it interferes with hearing and speaking that's why I am giving three stars only	0
Mahtab Uddin	2021-03-28	1	I have been using the app since May 2020. Everything was much better then. But it was difficult to join the meeting from the side. A few days later it was fixed. Again the screen sharing option is not working since it was updated in March 2021. I request you to fix the problem quickly with new update.	191

ChickenGirlCZE	2021-03-11	4	I love this app, because it's easy to use etc. But i would like if you added the mute/unmute option when you're outside the app. For example, when i write an exam online because of covid lockdown, and I'm on google docs for example, i can't mute/unmute, it would really help if you added this to the app.	29
Jean Douglas	2021-02-11	3	Ended up using laptop and phone simultaneously as when my host put us into breakout rooms I could hear everyone but not see them. The phone only allowed me to see anyone when they were speaking but that was better than the lap top which only showed me the home screen for zoom . I've used this app for almost a year & thought it brilliant but for the last few weeks it has been a disaster üòï	21

GasMan	2021-03-03	1	One starring just to get this read. The Sign Up/Sign In buttons don't play nice as you alter your settings to larger display sizes and font sizes.

G Medlock	2021-02-19	5	I personally never experienced any type of a lag on my device....the only negative item that comes to mind is on the phone only app I've used I believe is there is not any options for background filters like some other folks have I believe bcuz of tablets, laptops, or p.c. users but other than that for the reason I needed to use zoom video conferencing it was a spectacular tool & it truly impressed me bcuz i figured on my phone only it would b under par compared to the necessary level Thanxxx	16

Vincents Genesius Evans	2021-01-30	5	During this pandemic lockdown, this app has been a Godsent. + All the features and flexibility. LOVED it.. + I'm a Math teacher in Indonesia, I found the Features of this app (Breakout Room, Annotate, Screen-share) to be very useful + PRICE is quite affordable. + FULL features are available when using Windows PC - There seems to be NO WAY to have Breakout Room CONTROL if you are using Android tablet/phone app or Chromebook (webs app), even when you sign in as the HOST. - When using Chromebook, You cannot even download the Android app. - When using Chromebook, you cannot even ANNOTATE, again, EVEN when you sign in as the HOST. PLEASE work around this to make this amazing App MORE Versatile. Thanks you so much..	21

Plain OlAlex	2021-02-17	5	I would love to see a lot more of the desktop future is make its way over to the mobile app. Due to the fact that our phones are extremely powerful now and those of us that have powerful phones should be able to download maybe an add-on sweet that allows us to expand the app with more desktop features.

Al Farica	2021-02-07	3	why did you have to restrict some features like virtual background and whether or not you got green screen? Make it universal then for any user. It is so annoying in this such an era still afford restriction for just the matter of applications feature only because of device requirement. You get a cloud service that should make this application compatible to any devices regardless their specifications. At least, make it simple and affordable to latest smartphone with updated OS!	43

Zachery Tubb	2021-03-24	1	Zoom prevents other apps from using Bluetooth audio output while running. The app needs a complete overhaul of the audio handling system, stop chasing features that aren't supported by Android OS and develop an app that has stable and predictable features.	6

Samuel Akwaboah	2021-02-20	5	The Zoom app has very useful for me and i thank the people and individuals who pooled their resources together to develop this app. Ever since Covid 19 broke out in Ghana, our Universities had to shut down for a year. But with the Schools reopened, we had to resort to Zoom to avoid Crowded meetings and i haven't had any problem with the App except that that the number of participants should be increased more. Thanksüòä	12

R Ham	2021-02-06	1	"It was awful.I haven't used zoom in a while, and when I went on today it said that I wasn't signed in? I have had an account for a while now, and I've always been able to host zoom meetings. However, it said that I needed to sign in or sign up. I figured that it would be easier to sign up again,so thats what I did. After I had put in all of my information, it said that I was ""not eligible to sign up for zoom at this time."" It's been 20 minutes and that is still what the screen says.I am enraged."	11

Aldo Ch√°vez	2021-02-11	1	I hate this app. I have a good internet connection and even that this app would crash my meeting and take me out.

Go to hell.	184
Ramona Janis	2021-02-27	3	Greatly appreciate this format, the one draw back is the interference at times, more audio, infrequently video. The audio is better if I turn off the video. I have been getting disconnected more, which is frustrating when in meetings.	9

CROCHET ME PINK	2021-04-03	2	I pay a monthly fee but I'm thinking messenger is free. Constantly freezes & stutters. Whether on wifi/data or both. So not worth the money unless you have more than 10 people conferences & don't want to be shut off after 40 min. Again, thinking of canceling..	38
Tabasum Gul	2021-03-23	4	I give it only four star because it shows many types of errors that it should not show and there is no recording option so that we can repeat what was told in meeting and more than 100 people can't join meeting .

BEVERLY Dye	2021-04-06	5	I hope these folks aren't giving up too soon and have made the negative comments. Zoom is wonderful way of staying in touch with your family that are scattered everywhere with work colleagues and with friends that live where you used to live. Zoom will find the speaker and bring him to your attention so you don't have to search the faces. You'll find it a wonderful way to stay in touch regardless of your purposes. Don't give up too soon. Zoom is a wonderful tool just patiently learn to use it	2

D E M I	2021-04-10	4	It's nice. Quite easy to use and automatically switch to landscape mode when you rotate your phone. Video quality is good too. I just wished that the virtual background feature can be used in the phone version too someday. That would have been nice üëç	25
Loretto Reid	2021-03-26	5	Always so great. Use for music lessons. Looking forward when actually 2 or more can play @ same time. Is the same with all other Media. Zoom seem to have a better edge on. Have noticed recently that is improving & if 1 person plays very quiet, sort of works.	74

Maher Nurul Huda	2021-03-02	4	Since many people do online zoom classes nowadays, you should allow us to resize videos however we desire as well (similar to the way we can resize the shared screen) so that we can see the contents on the board more clearly. Also, please don't rotate screen if the auto rotate of the device is turned off.	2

Tunde Degla	2021-03-18	4	Very good. But i have a suggestion.if a group is connecting through a device,let there be a way of listing members in that group so that if a member wants to speak,he will be selected from the list.so others will know who is speaking from the name displayed.	2

Amber Duan	2021-04-08	1	It's pretty much impossible to connect to dial-in audio bc the automated reception system somehow expects you to enter the 11-digit meeting ID in half a second.

Raphael Songolo	2021-01-28	5	"Mostly schools use Zoom and I've heard reports that students tend to leave zoom in the middle of a class. So, I checked all of the settings but I couldn't find anything that can prevent people from leaving zoom without the hosts consent. I then wondered if y'all can come up with a settings feature that can make people unable to exit zoom meetings without the hosts consent. Please take this into consideration. A lot of teachers need this. This application is good by the way. ""5 stars for me."""	7

Nelly Dilemma	2021-03-23	1	I constantly cannot hear people talking on the other side. And sometimes you see the mute button and sometimes you don't as this causes noise background if you're listening in on training. It's frustrating and it will keep on loading and give you an error	8

Abhi Harikrishnan	2021-02-11	5	If there was a provision to delete the messages in the chats, it would be a revolutionary thing. Also the space bar for temporary unmute at times when the chat box is open is an irritant, instead of unmute it just does the normal function. Rest all üíØüíØ.	22

Melvin Lai	2021-03-02	1	Absolute trash. This app automatically mutes u in all meetings and THERE IS NO UNMUTE button. I showed this to my work colleagues and no one could find the Unmute.

N. Duncan	2021-03-28	1	Very confusing did not have the same options that everybody else had at the time of being able to view my father's service and that pissed me off more than anything because it was enough that I couldn't afford to go home for my dad's funeral but then this thing didn't work at all for what I want to see also so this is going off my phone for sure	23

Chris Lee	2021-01-25	5	Zoom is much easy to use and to collaborate with different users in comparison to other similar program. As long as they keep the data by themselves and not sharing to any other government agency or worst yet foreign government. It is a good choice to go with.	5
‡∑É‡∑í‡∂≠‡∑ô‡∑Ñ‡∑í ‡∂ã‡∂¥‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ö‡∑Ä‡∑í	2021-04-29	5	The problem is security. Make a way atleast to show the IP address of users. Don't allow name change within a meeting.	0

Yash Diwakar	2021-03-01	3	One of the most useful app in such time.. It's a great app for online lectures and office meetings but it can be improved if app has inbuilt features that ADMIN CAN CONTROL TO SHARING MEETING LINK AND GOT TO KNOW WHO SHARES MEETING LINK. ANYONE CAN JOIN MEETING VIA LINK (obvi.admin isn't going to check all participants) WHICH ISN'T GOOD FOR CONFIDENTIAL MEETING	1
jaimin kadia	2021-04-07	1	My mobile model is Samsung A 32 and the CAMERA does not work in your application rather it hangs zoom application whenever i try to start the camera. Kindly do the needful. I will be much obliged. The camera works in other applications like whats app and google .eet.	21

Maryam Salama	2021-02-03	5	I really like zoom and I use it daily and I with it could be better and better so i just suggest that you could add something , First 1Ô∏è‚É£ you could add something like sharing the video to the host only (teacher) for example, so my video will only be seen by the teacher not all people that are in the meeting.2Ô∏è‚É£ Maybe you could do something like meeting history where I the host or participant can see later who was in the meeting so we could check things.I really thank you so much for you efforts.	10

Benjamin McEwan	2021-02-28	5	Zoom has really nice data compression so the video quality is excellent even if the other person has very weak signal.

Thank you and hope you to look at this point and support it.	9

Brandan Blevins	2021-01-14	1	Can't set a background on the Android app. The Chrome OS experience is even worse. I have no idea why Zoom is the video conferencing option that everyone has selected, it's an awful experience on anything except a Windows desktop.	12

Maaz Ahmed Siddiqui	2021-04-09	1	I'm unable to connect to the meeting, either it takes too long to connect and then I'm disconnected within 5 mins or it shows some connection problem with the service after an endless attempt to join to the meeting.

Krystal Mann	2021-01-18	5	This is too all the people who have made a bad review to this app . Mainly pk9 kraft dude wuth the skull profile picture. I use this app twice every week for meetings and it's amazing yes it has it's moments it freezes but so does all the others so don't go saying bad things about it just because your not using it s perfectly fine. All it needs to do is have a meeting with your mates or work colleagues. You don't know how hard it is to make an app like this. STOP BEING RUDE! Chew on that! üò°	9

I was so happy for actually finally trying it. That I went & set up a meeting to invite my whole family...Almost everyone of my family members where happy to meet & from then on we started meeting every other week.

Lily Andrus	2021-04-07	4	It is a professional, reliant and clean app. Totally accessible for Visually Challenged individuals. There are some herdles when we people have to host but after knowing the shortcuts and the fact that recording is only supported on laptop, it got easier.	24

Becky Garcia	2021-02-12	2	This app would work for 2 minutes and then disconnect. We had to wait for it to reboot, and then would get a few minutes before it disconnected again. I was trying to teach a class. Now I am looking for a different app to use.	12

marko xcx	2021-03-05	1	it's impossible to connect the zoom audio to my bluetooth earbuds from my laptop so i can't even have a private meeting. literally everything else will be playing on the earbuds and zoom will SAY connected but it just plays out loud on the speakersüôÉ id really like to go to therapy without blasting it out loud for the house to hear thanks	24
Sinto M. N	2021-04-04	5	It's wonderful especially when you have a little bit of stable internet connectivity. One it gives room for sharing of screams and the host ultimate authority to mute or even take others microphones away to minimize interruptions, meetings are well managed.	29

Amit Kumar Patra	2021-02-24	4	It'd be nice if the app considers about the rounded corner models of these days. At corner, so many things are not visible. If the things are moved to little inside then it can be visible I guess.	1

Low Batt	2021-02-03	1	I turned ON my video & saw myself in the little window on bottom right corner of the main screen (pg 2) and also in the gallery view (pg 3) throughout the conference so I ignored the messages asking us to turn on our videos. Much later only I knew that other people couldn't see my video. Page 1 on safe driving mode showed the video is STOPPED and in the participants list, the red symbol showed the video is OFF too. Zoom itself has contradicting and misleading indication! Please rectify.	3

CantalouP gMes	2021-03-04	1	The only reason I'm using this app is because some of my teachers use zoom. This is one of the worst apps. It often does not connect and I need to join from browser. Google meet is much better than this.	32

Ros Ingram	2021-01-27	4	Seems reasonably straight forward to use. A little getting used to where all the controls lurk when you're in it was necessary for me. Useful app as zoom seems to be widely used among people I know.	2
Raagav's Time	2021-04-10	1	This app is very worst in my life. Google meet, Jio meet are very excellent in meetings. But the zoom meeting is very worst. Some problems are there.
