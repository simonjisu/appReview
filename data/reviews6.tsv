Joseph Leydon	2021-03-09	2	Inconsistent, constant problems with both audio and video being users and groups. I.T. reported problems go unresolved and are constantly increasing with usage. If I could avoid using zoom, I would. But as the threat of exposure to the virus continues, the more zoom chooses to forgo the need to resolve problems. The reason for monopolies to change doesn't exist! If not zoom, then who? No end in sight!	0

Howdy Howdy Howdy	2021-03-09	1	One of the biggest problems that zoom has is how quickly it kills the battery on a mobile device and how hot my device had become. This just makes me turn zoom away even more then the security issues. This is, to me, a zoom only issue as other similar apps like duo does not have this issues. It honestly surprised me as I only used it for a hour with a 56% charge, after that hour it became hot to the touch and 10%. When the security issues are fixed and this overheating issue I would reconsider	0

Javat vasi Das	2021-02-26	5	Zoom Cloud Meetings take the anxiety out of participating in high profile online webinars. They also facilitate very nice meetings with old friends who can recite their favourite spiritual books together. You are enabling a vital connection in our worldwide Hare Krishna to be, not only maintained but also, elevated to previously unthinkable levels.	0
arjun pragada	2021-05-21	1	Sure ly super app but I Not love this because time waste due to classes	0
Renee' Hampton	2021-03-10	3	Little slow on my phone versus my laptop. My phone has a stronger signal. Choppy at times. I use both at the sametime b/c the volume on my phone is louder. However, defeats the purpose when it freezes or is very choppy. The video footage is great, when not frozen but the audio could be better due to the usebof my phone AND my laptop at the same time.	0
Anshu Phogat	2021-04-18	4	I read in hr. Green field school, this app is very helpful for classes, meeting with friends, family and it's features is also awesome, it's very easy to use I like this very much thanks for this app😇😇😇	0

Anthony Dedrick	2021-02-10	5	"Amazing! I use it works but I will say that sometimes I am mad with zoom it takes steps to get into meeting and it just made it hard to get in I think it has fancy details before you get into the meeting it says ""join by computer audio or phone audio or call me"" I have pressed always computer audio and it asked me once again. But overall I am happy with zoom and there system that's why I gave them a all star rating! 😊"	0

5B 23 Manjima Ganguly	2021-02-10	5	This update is the best update ever. There are many resons why I liked this update so much. 1) When I click on a participant in the participant's list insted of straightly allowing chat with that participant its showing a option called chat which I really liked. 2)It has resolved the problem of putting the video of when I go to the participants list and to the chat box. All is fine with the app all what you need actually is a good internet connection and you can't blame zoom for this .Thank you.	0

E Mo	2021-03-14	1	Up until a month ago this app worked beautifully. Then it started having issues. I figured that maybe there was an issue with the app and so I uninstalled it. When I tried reinstall the app through the Google Play store it says that my Google Samsung Pro is NO LONGER SUPPORTED?!? What the hay!!! WHY?!? Now I can only us Zoom if I go through the Chrome app!! I'm not sure if it's Google's fault or Zoom's fault but what IDIOT came up with that idea?!?	0

Peppa Pig	2021-02-23	1	"Very frustrating, yes. Sometimes when I click the link to join a meeting it takes me to the ""launch meeting"" page, and I click ""launch meeting"". But it doesn't do anything, until I exit out of that tab and go to my home screen and click the Zoom icon. That's where it will pop up, and the meeting is frozen. Another thing, it always says ""your interest connection is unstable "" when it's not. It also stops me from doing things when someone screen shares or stops screen sharing."	0

Shreta Gupta	2021-04-17	1	Worst app, I m very sad that I m not able to give it 0 star. At first the app was good, but now it has become worst, even if u have the best network in the world, then also it will show error!	1
FF KUNAL GAMING	2021-01-19	4	the number of people for meeting is all right....it has many more features like presenting and also messaging to anyone privately or for every one...like it feels good even when we are not in class... but the reason I gave four stars is that I am not very satisfied about timing.timing is just 40 minutes....it should be 50 minute or 1 hour maybe. It cause a problem about timing.Our teacher would teach us something which is important and it suddenly disappear which is not good.must improve timing	2
Saravanan Anthiyur	2021-05-20	3	Nice one. I've got virtual background on my desktop but I didn't get for my android 10 in here so, kindly fix it. I've been facing some bugs so it must be fixed.	0

Shuñ Kuñ	2021-01-25	3	I like everything about this app but there's one serious problem with this. Auto rotate, even if auto rotate is off the video rotates by itself which is seriously inconvenient because when the call auto rotates it leads to several misclicks which results in unmute or start the video in times which you dont want, worst part is sometimes we dont even know if we misclicked and till then people can hear or see whats going on in the background. Please fix this	4
Sudhaker Singh	2021-02-03	2	You definitely need to work on this app a lot, developers. There is a strange glitch during a meeting. Even if my video is on, the participants list always shows that my video is turned off. This has actually led to my class teacher marking me absent in some of the live classes because my video is off, which is definitely frustrating. Other than that, it also has some flaws which need to be fixed. Please do fix them.	3

Or else We'll be using another app. Thank you❤️"	1

Rahul More	2021-04-06	5	Hi I have been usin this app from the April of 2020 for my educational purpose, I had great experiences with it. It also wasn't consuming much data. It's nice and it's features are also marvelous but since the month of March 2021, I had observed that the 'Zoom' app is consuming much data for meetings then earlier. Please fix this problem With Regards User of 'Zoom' Vaibhav More	0

SONALAL SAH	2021-05-18	1	The security of the meeting is extremely poor because unknown students can come and easily distract teacher's attention and use vulgar words.

Tony Rice	2021-02-16	5	Excellent simple as that, we had to pivot to online teaching with covid19 lock down. Teaching children and having to guide many hundreds off our clients to getting the Zoom app and having to guide only a few parents thorough the app process, just showed us how easy the app can be used. For us the ease of recording videos and up loading to you tube for our future online training was so easy. Would recommend anyone to use it for lessons, conferences, online get together, simple and easy.	0

Adul Ashref	2021-03-12	1	This app is built very poorly for phones.No video background even for phones that meet the requirements posted on the website.Newer versions switch the audio to speakers when receiving a call or even playing back a video when zoom is in background. Video turns off when zoom is in background.No user interface to switch between microphone inputs. Forced Auto-rotation by zoom even when screen orientation is locked.Participants list takes up full screen and rotates your phone to portait. Fix needed.	1

FoxyBeanie	2021-02-07	2	I used this to chat with my friends,thinking,I'd be cool to retry Zoom instead of Meet.Instant regret.The reason I'm putting 2 stars,is because they have the option to send messages to certain people in the meet.Connecton was good too.But overall,it just wasn't compatible and convenient.Chat was a bit laggymand sometimes it automatically made you send a message to just 1 person like as a default or something.I'd recommend if there needs to be some private convo in between,but Meet is recommend.	0

Aniket pardeshi	2021-03-01	3	So far this app has proven effective.The video is clear & fast,it has minimum technical issues when starting up and throughout the user experience. Overall it's a good app but it's net issue Is the biggest issue.If you have a good network connection then also sometimes it shows errors.Sometimes you get disconnected from the meeting.Sometimes your mic gets turned on automatically and you can't even understand.so from my point of view I'll give 3 starts to this app.	0

Some people relly struggled to log in and missed 20 minutes of our session. 4. I understood I was paying on a monthly basis as was advertised on your website but you've charged me for the whole year! 5. Cannot see previous chat, like teams	2

Piano-Plants Channel	2021-02-01	1	I appreciate that this is one of the best applications around the globe for education and working. However, this is becoming seriously terrible because I couldn't continue to attend the meetings when so many people were connecting to the Internet together at the same time. Moreover, it seems to me that you should improve the quality of backgrounds so that the application itself will be more attractive and friendly to users.	0

Suvarna Sail	2021-02-05	3	Nothing is updated in the new update just the look of the pop-up when we tap the more button is changed little bit and at the start screen 'starred' option is added. The app is good but a wrong thing is there that though the network is strong the video always lags and 1 more problem which works in some mobiles but its serious that though his/her video is on in the participants list it shows off and please give subtitles and Please solve these problems. So i rate this app with 3 stars	0

Chiron Jayasundara	2021-01-11	1	I hate this app since it consumes a lot of my mobile data and it eventually logs out from the meeting.

Most importantly it carries a huge of data with the updating stuff I hope that zoom cloud meeting would be a app if it would listen and make it right	7

The only thing is that (only sometimes) if I pin my teacher's video to my screen if some others speak it will take to their screen. Pls see this issue. That is why -1star. I give it a 4 then. Other than this nothing is commentable. Thank you for designing this app.👏👏	0

PIYUSH KUMAR	2021-01-11	1	This app was good but now a days it is working in very bad condition/ pathetic condition. This needs to be modulate. The connectivity of this app is now a days very bad I am continously disconnecting again and again. When I am seeing the participants list automatically my video turns off, this needs to be change. Sometimes I cannot hear the voice of somebody but my network connection was very good. I have also reported tozoom about the problems I have faced. But then also I am facing problems	1006

Bobbi Sandz	2021-01-14	1	The audio will NOT work on my smartphone. It will only allow you to connect audio over internet. If you do that you lose video. This is preventing people from doing at home Covid-19 testing. While I have a computer to use most people do not and this is unacceptable. Uninstalling.	0
Jasmin Samaroo	2021-06-21	3	This app is good and all...but it breaks up sometimes and i cant even hear others...so i'll give it 3 stars.	0
ravioli man	2021-01-16	1	Bad, if you can, use another video call app. The internet is choppy at best, and even if it doesn't lag you out of the meeting, it is generally mediocre. The video feedback is bad, to the point where you can't show anything with your camera on. Bad, wouldn't recommend.	0

Nonya Biznaz	2021-01-13	1	Smart View: No sound Fixed. This is a glitch. I had 2 phones projecting sound through TV. Then one stopped. Then while troubleshooting, the other stopped. The change occurred when I used the 'working' phone to rip TV control from the 'non-working' phone. So with 2 phones not working with smart-view I added a blue-tooth speaker for sound. Hokey work-around. At the end of the meeting I shut-down the speaker and noticed volume control for zoom switched back to TV. Problem solved. Zoom team help: 0	561

Juthika Das	2021-05-05	1	Guys don't download this app.This is the worst video calling app. It have many rules to be verified but this is not the problem.

So I have to sing in every time when I open the app for use. This incident harasses me.. Secondly this app uses browser to sing in when I use facebook account. My ac can be hacked for that	1

Lowell Day	2021-02-27	1	Extremely poor security and privacy practices. End to end encryption is a meaningless marketing lie, unless the private keys are stored locally *only* on the users' devices. Don't even get me started with the sideloading nonsense that the Zoom website encourages. This app is a joke, they just got lucky when the pandemic hit and users flocked to their app. My suggestion as an information security pro: Use Signal video calls instead, they have functionality that surpasses Zoom in every way.	0

Kelli Farrington	2021-04-10	4	Pretty decent video call application and goes with many devices. Very handy for the pandemic but still annoying because work places think day off for the employee so they can just use zoom. Zoom is good overall you can make accounts to create zooms and either use free meeting for certain amount of people or do it where more people can join. Great way to do interviews or virtual conventions even though the feeling won't be there but good for celebrity meet and greets if they were into be panera.	0

Shahanaz Parvin	2021-05-22	5	Zoom is a good app. Many thanks to the one who made it because a Kovid Nineteen has given a lockdown for coming so now it is forbidden to go out plus school is closed so kids now take classes in Zoom app and especially if no one made this app now kids would have more reading and writing effect.	0

Nothing is audible.....Pls fix if possible...	0
Pupsikas Falan	2021-05-22	1	Usless app. Can't do proper auto sign in with google had to click on the link. No audio in or out. Pointless. My recomendation is to use discord or teams. Since i cant give negative star so I give the lowest one.	0

51.Shrishti Rajwade	2021-04-06	1	This app is horrible!! I really don't understand the interface of this app When I click on mute button my voice reaches to the other person in the call and When I unmute my mic my voice doesn't reach... This app got me really confused And If I am not wrong, Mute means to refrain voice so that it can't reach to the other person and opposite for unmute	1

Zoom has too many issues as to even interfere with my only camera during college classes. I am afraid of my privacy rights as my camera was tampered with by zoom and sometimes i cant even use my camera because it doesn't ""detect it"". Cant use it on my phone for no real reason other than zoom pretends to ignore my android phone thinking its not a phone. Its a smart phone 2020 model- Samsung-"	0

Natan Tilahun	2021-01-13	3	Thank you for your continued efforts to make the app user-friendly. Raise hand feature improvement is a step in the right direction. If we could be able to see more participants in tablets, it would be even more awesome! For a large tablet, seeing only 4 is waste of screen space. If there was an option to select how many participants to see though, it would be great.	16

Sylvia Vargas	2021-03-23	3	All types of issues...connection, no sound at first, stuck for a couple minutes in a frozen screen towards middle of call. Some of the issues might have been operator error or a lagging WiFi. It would be unfair to give this app a poor review when some issues were probably not the apps' fault.	0

Sahadev Kundu	2021-02-08	3	According to me, ZOOM meetings is not a good app. The first star goes for its bad service. It is impossible to join when on computer. And the other one for its absence of thumbnail. Other than that its perfect.	0
